Post Date: What is going to change that trend line?

See chart below. 

A lot of people laid off in 2023 are having a hard time finding a job. 

Some of them, if they were at big tech companies, may have received generous severance packages.  But often those packages are not enough to retire. 

F-1 students who are struggling to find a job should consider returning to school to pursue a STEM Ph.D. 

US immigration law provides for more options for STEM-based Ph.D. Graduates. Some of those benefits are subtle. 

I hope to write more about that dynamic soon, at my newsletter (blog), linked in my bio.

Post Date: EB-2 NIW I-140 petitions can be filed with USCIS via regular processing or premium processing.  

USCIS is raising the filing fee of premium processing for these kinds of cases from $2,500.00 to $2,805.00.

Are you getting something better or new and improved for the higher price?  No, of course not.

Pending I-140s can be 'converted' from regular to premium processing and USCIS has 45 calendar days to review the filing after the conversion request, although if the conversion is filed after April 1, 2024, then it is a gray area how things will be handled as April 1 is the date when USCIS goes from "calendar days" to "business days" in calculating things for premium processing.

Raising prices for slower processing.  Joy!

###

It is important to know that a premium process I-140 will not necessarily get you a green card faster so in many instances regular processing is just fine.  There are some instances where a premium process I-140 is important like (i) becoming eligible for an H-1B extension beyond 6 years or (ii) creating eligibility for an H-4 spouse to get an EAD.

You will want to analyze the pros and cons of premium processing case-by-case.  

Regular processing EB-2 NIW I-140 processing is slow.  Many cases are now pending 6 months or longer.  This is the way things work at USCIS.  They seem to neglect certain categories of cases and rationalize it by thinking, 'well, if you wanted it fast, you could pay for premium processing.'

Sometimes there will be an initiative to go faster.  That is not likely to occur with USCIS on this case type.  There is probably further rationalization within USCIS that because Visa Bulletin cut-off dates are backed up, there is no rush to process EB2 I-140s.  This is pretty much what they do for I-130s for family members.  

So, between the availability of premium processing and the rationalization of Visa Bulletin backlogs, I suspect USCIS will continue to rationalize slow and slower processing times.  Dumb & dumber.  Slow & slower.

###

Paying for premium processing is useful for peace of mind, knowing your case is approved.  

It is unfortunate that 'peace' is so expensive.  

But hey, everything is expensive these days.

Post Date: Cross-Chargeability.  A lot of people know about this, but some people don't.

-- The wait times for green cards on the Visa Bulletin are based on country of birth, not country of citizenship.  So if you were born in India and you become a citizen of Canada, you are subject to the India wait times, not the Canada wait times.  So that's something bad.

-- But US immigration law does recognize "cross-chargeability," that is, if you were born in India but your spouse was born in UAE, you are able to use your spouse's country of birth - even if your spouse has never been a citizen of that country where he/she was born.

-- Cross-chargeability can be incredibly useful.  And hey, if you are in the market for a spouse, it might be on your wish list!

Post Date: PROCESSING TIME versus IMMIGRANT VISA AVAILABILITY.  A key concept in US immigration law that is often confused.

-- PROCESSING TIME is how long a certain agency will take to review a case.  So the US Department of Labor (DOL) might take 8 months to review a PERM application and that is the PROCESSING TIME.  And if you pay for premium processing to USCIS for your I-140, that reduces the PROCESSING TIME.

-- IMMIGRANT VISA AVAILABILITY relates to backlogs and quotas as documented through the monthly Visa Bulletin.

###

Traditionally employment-based immigrants from most countries did not have to worry about IMMIGRANT VISA AVAILABILITY, but now they do.

Since the beginning of time, family-based immigrants have faced these issues and been confused.  If you have a US citizen sibling who is going to sponsor you for an I-130, it doesn't matter if the I-130 gets approved in 6 months (that's PROCESSING TIME), you are not getting your green card for many, many years (that's IMMIGRANT VISA AVAILABILITY).

###

And also, separate from this issue of PROCESSING TIME versus IV AVAILABILITY, and equally important:  Filing an I-140 or an I-130 does not confer status.  

--> You don't get to stay in the US and work just because an I-140 or I-130 was filed for you.

Particularly in the world of family-based immigration, I think people sometimes just don't want to know the rules.  They realize the rules are crazy so they sort of pretend they don't understand them.

If you want to ignore the rules, that's a separate thing.  But try to know what the rules are.  They are (for the most part) knowable.

Sometimes it feels like these are all people leaving the US but I know that is not true. 

•••

I would expect this big increase is bringing challenges in housing and services like healthcare as it is hard for any society to have spikes like this. 

Not exactly the same, but even places like New York City are struggling with a surge in newly arrived immigrants (while a lot of long time residents of NYC move to Nashville and Miami).

Post Date: In recent weeks I have been contacted by several people who live and work outside the United States and are interested in EB-2 NIW.

These are professionals who have never been to the United States.

While traditionally not common, it is possible to petition for a green card from abroad using EB-2 NIW.  It is not particularly fast and not everyone is eligible, but it might be the best option for someone who thinks their career will benefit from being able to live and work in the United States.

I will say that one other category that is coming up a lot recently are people who are in the US now but anticipate going abroad (because their temporary visa status runs out or because of personal/family/professional reasons) but want to return in a couple years.  EB-2 NIW could work well for those people.

###

With these people in mind, I have written an updated primer on EB-2 NIW for people who are trying to understand it, at a "101" level - although it dawns on me now that using Dwight from the Office in a meme might not be the right theme for a global audience.

Then again, President Biden has brought Scranton to the world!

F-1 student working in healthcare and whose employer was unwilling to sponsor her for H-1B.  She was pro-active and we filed the I-140/I-485 just before cut-off dates were introduced into the EB-2 ROW category in the December 2022 Visa Bulletin.

Post Date: If you are a citizen of Canada and you have a complex TN case, note that Canadian TN petitions can be filed by mail to USCIS directly and you are not required to process at US Customs.

For many years these TNs were processed in Vermont.  Now it is Texas.

It is true that the documentation for a mail-in TN is more involved (Form I-129/TN supplement, etc.), and it is also true that there will be more filing fees (including possible I-907 premium processing) but in my experience the USCIS adjudicators are very reasonable on TN adjudications so if you are trying to get a TN in a category that is subject to a lot of scrutiny, like "Management Consultant" or "Scientific Technician" - you should talk to your employer about filing by mail, including people turned away by CBP in the past.

You can also do the same thing for L-1s by mail.  We handle a lot of intermittent L-1s and some US Customs officers seem totally perplexed by a guy who has held L-1 status for 10+ years, entering the US only 2-3 months per year to visit customers, etc. -- but the USCIS officers actually get it.

If you get an I-797 approval notice from USCIS, for a TN or L-1, then you can drive or fly into the US with less drama.  Nothing worse than being interrogated at Pearson or Peace Bridge.

NOTE:  The mail-in process only works for Canadian TNs and is not permitted for Mexican TNs, which is annoying.

Post Date: This weekend the anti-immigration political parties did very well in the elections in France and Germany. 

In this era of post-pandemic higher inflation, voters around the world seem unhappy. 

Unhappy voters don’t bode well for parties in power. 

Modi’s party in India also underperformed expectations. 

What does that mean for the US?  President Biden has already tried to recalibrate by putting out a very restrictive new asylum policy earlier this month. 

It seems unlikely in the US we will see any pro-immigration initiatives until after the election. 

The current political ethos gives plenty of cover for the government agencies to do what they do best - nothing. 

Slow processing will likely get slower.

Of those, 5 were filed via premium processing.  

Of those filed via premium processing, 4 are already approved and 1 is still pending.

Even for regular, non-premium processing EB-2 NIW I-140s, we are seeing approvals for cases filed in April 2023.  

So premium processing cases are often reviewed in a month, or less, and non-premium processing cases are reviewed in 4 months.

###

Meanwhile, for PERM labor certification cases, submitted to the U.S. Department of Labor, we are awaiting 9141 prevailing wage requests submitted in March 2023, and we are awaiting approvals of 9089 PERM applications filed in September 2022.

There has never been a more disparate difference in processing times between PERM applications and PERM-exempt I-140s.

Post Date: European E-2 dependent:  Approved for EB-2 NIW.

Today (June 7, 2024), we got an approval for a premium process EB-2 NIW I-140.  In this case, the wife is the "principal" E-2 for a small business and the husband was able to use his E-2S open-market work authorization to get a job as a technology and supply chain professional and then he self-petitioned for EB-2 NIW based on his profile.

The family will immigrant visa process and the wife will continue to run the small business in the meantime.

Many people rightfully lament that there is not necessarily a route to a green card for E-2 small business owners.  

Many people just try to plow ahead and file EB-2 NIW through the principal but not all small business owners on E-2s are well-suited for EB-2 NIW.

Less commonly considered is structuring the E-2 situation so that the 'better suited' spouse should be the dependent.

###

Not all nationalities are eligible for E-2s but for those nationalities who are eligible, "using" the dependent spouse as a means to getting a green card is often underutilized/underappreciated.

Post Date: EB-2 NIW I-140 approved in 14 days, via premium processing at Nebraska Service Center.

###

Self-petitioning physician in H-1B status contacted us after realizing that employer was pursuing very slow PERM process.  After realizing that employer was still waiting for 9141 after several months, we moved ahead on a self-petition EB-2 NIW I-140 via premium process.

Approved in 14 days and now spouse can qualify for H-4/H-4 EAD work permit.  

In terms of evidence:  Case was filed with self-petitioner cover letter and no other support letters (to save time/money).  Approved in 14 days.  Client did have strong research profile which could be documented via CV, Google Scholar report of citations, and copies of key articles and other documentation to establish he is well-positioned to positively impact an area of public/national importance.

This idea that you need lots of letters or a formal "business plan" is oversold.   Sometimes those things help, but case preparation and evidence in EB-2 NIW cases, and frankly all immigration cases, should be customized to the facts.

Admittedly, Visa Bulletin cut-off dates are still frustrating...

Some of the fee increases are outrageous. 

And remember that premium processing goes from calendar days to business days. 

I think that’s some kind of immigration version of shrinkflation - more expensive for slower decisions. 

In the private sector we are permitted to call that out as greed. Not sure what we are supposed to say about it when our government does it to us. 

But perhaps worse than the absolute increase in fees is the completely absurd system that charges so many different rates based on case type and employer size and non-profits get a deal sometimes and yada, yada. 

It was reported that USCIS assistant director for fee increases, Rube Goldberg, said, “These fee increases start April 1 and they are no joke. They represent a masterpiece and perhaps my greatest work ever.”

Post Date: EB-2 NIW:  Who is the petitioner?

Many large (and small) employers have figured out that PERM is super slow and some of them are offering, at last, to sponsor their employees for green cards through EB-2 NIW.  This is good!

When this happens, nearly always the employer's lawyer will handle the process and file the case with the EMPLOYER as the petitioner.  This is certainly better than PERM given how slow and frustrating PERM is (and assuming the candidate is qualified for EB-2 NIW).  

But having the EMPLOYER as I-140 petitioner limits the benefits of EB-2 NIW as one of the big perks of EB-2 NIW is that you can self-petition so that if you change employers, the EB-2 NIW case is attached to you personally.

If the EMPLOYER is the petitioner, then if you change employers, then the EB-2 NIW I-140 approval does not provide you the same benefits.  (Yes, you can retain your priority date but you still need a new I-140).

Some of these same employers (and their lawyers) will try to keep you from getting a complete copy of the I-140 petition filing.  They will rationalize this in various ways but basically they are just being annoying.  Some of the most famous immigration law practices in the world do this.  (You know who you are!)

But even if your employer will not give you a complete copy of the I-140 filing, USCIS will allow you to do a FOIA request and obtain a complete copy of the I-140 filing.  This is true for all types of I-140s.

In one instance, we are working with someone to re-package their employer-filed EB-2 NIW case to file it as a self-petition.  We are able to do this at a fraction of the cost by leveraging the employer filed case but getting the person an approval as a self-petition.

[As an aside, we are also doing this for employer-filed O-1s, repackaging them for EB-2 NIW self-petitions].

Having yourself as the I-140 petitioner, that is, having a SELF-PETITION is particularly important for people from India and China who have absurdly long waits for green cards; but people of all nationalities will benefit from self-petition I-140 approvals so they won't have to re-start the green card process at a new employer.

The link to the USCIS FOIA page is in the first comment below.  To the credit of the agency, USCIS is often very fast at producing a complete copy of the I-140 filing.  This is true for both PERM and PERM-exempt I-140s (like EB-2 NIW).

Critical to the success of such a case would be to articulate and document distinctive contributions to promote sustainability (less energy use, or alternative energy use, etc) in this work. 

Perhaps that involves the use of advanced tech to measure power use or new materials or new construction/build strategies. 

Your work might tie into academic projects you completed. 

You might be early in your career and therefore designated by your team to use new (advanced) tools. 

Sadly, if you work at a large and prestigious organization, it is likely that your employer is represented by a large law firm whose EB immigration lawyers just want to funnel everyone into the H-1B cap or the snail-pace PERM process. 

You probably need to figure out alternatives on your own.

Post Date: Relatively high and sustained interest rates impact the economy in different ways. 

Economists use the term “long and variable lags” to describe the impact higher interest rates have. 

It seems that farmers have been negatively impacted by high interest rates (and the high value of the US dollar relative to other currencies can hurt exports) - so this is leading to farmers having less money to buy equipment and leading to the equipment manufacturers revising their forecasts down. 

Sometimes revising profit forecasts will lead to layoffs. 

Layoffs lead to an inability (for various reasons) for employers to sponsor H-1B and other workers for green cards. 

If your employer is laying people off, it is very likely they will halt PERM labor certification applications. 

•••

Despite challenges at individual employers, the Biden Administration continues to articulate a support for improvements in manufacturing for self-petition green cards. 

These improvements often come through sustainability initiatives or supply chain innovations.  But there are a myriad of things that engineers do that can broadly impact manufacturing positively. 

Engineers working in manufacturing are often well-suited to self-petition for a green card through EB-2 NIW. 

We continue to have good success on those cases but both premium and non-premium adjudications have gotten slower.

Post Date: Physicians from all over the world come to the United States and seek to build their careers and lives here.  But physician immigration has a lot of highly technical and slightly obscure issues, even beyond the traditional issues and challenges faced in EB immigration.

Physicians often (although certainly not always) come to the US initially in J-1 visa status.  Sometimes they come in a research-based J-1. Other times it is a clinical J-1.  There are actually significant differences in the impact on whether you come on a research J-1 or clinical J-1.

Our team has handled a large number of self-petition physicians over the past several years, helping physicians transition from a research J-1 to a green card before embarking on a clinical residency or fellowship.

Even with the emergence of EB-2 cut-off dates on the Visa Bulletin for all nationalities it can be possible to navigate the process to maximize options.

In a recent case we were retained by a research J-1 physician from Brazil who was subject to the two-year home residence requirement.  As a research J-1 (versus clinical J-1), this physician was able to obtain a SKILLS LIST NO OBJECTION WAIVER.

Further, this physician was also fortunate enough to match to a clinical residency and that residency program is willing to sponsor her for an H-1B (which not all residency programs will do and does require that the physician pass USMLE Steps 1-3 before the H-1B petition filing).

We were retained to help on the SKILLS LIST J-1 waiver (although many people do this without an attorney).  And we also filed an EB-2 NIW petition for her.  The EB-2 NIW I-140 was filed initially via regular processing, then converted to premium processing and approved just 7 days after being converted to premium process.

After the J-1 waiver was approved and after she matched to a residency program willing to sponsor her for H-1B, it made sense to convert the pending EB-2 NIW from regular to premium processing to get the I-140 approved.  This will allow her husband to immediately go from J-2 with an EAD to H-4 with an EAD while they wait for their priority date to be current.

A primary objective was navigating options for the physician wife; but equally important to the couple was a strategy that gave seamless work authorization to the J-2 (and future H-4) husband.

Many physicians wait too long to pursue self-petition options.  They do this because they are focused on their career (reasonable enough) or some of them think that they can simply wait and have their employer sort it out later.  Neither is a good reason.

Some physicians don't think their profile is strong enough for EB-2 NIW and they misunderstand some of the nuance in the tangled thicket of immigration rules.

Physicians who have NOT been sponsored for a green card, regardless of their immigration status, and even those still abroad hoping to immigrate, should be planning ahead on what their options are.

Post Date: Regarding the EB-2 RoW (Rest of World) backlog on the Visa Bulletin-

When you work with EB-2 RoW people regularly, you realize that many of them have not spent the time and energy to understand the US immigration system like many long-suffering Indian-born professionals have.

So, sometimes an EB-2 RoW professional will very casually say something like, "I am busy now.  I will work on this in 6 months" -- and that is a reasonable thing on some level.  

I do realize that immigration should not rule your life.

I mean, it rules my life, but I am vocationally masochistic.

###

What these EB-2 RoW people don't understand is that waiting six months does NOT correspond to a six-month delay in getting a green card.

Waiting 6 months probably corresponds to a 12-24 month (or perhaps longer?) delay.

The queue is clearly getting longer.

The Visa Bulletin dates move slower.

The number of immigrant visas (Green Cards) available each year has gone done from a very high number in FY2021 and FY2022 and will continue to go down until it is back to the base of 140k.  

So the number of green cards goes down, but more and more people are getting in the queue.

###

It is definitely fine to wait 6 months or whatever, but just know it is not just 6 months.

###

And for all the Indians who have figured out that EB-1 is really the key to the ballgame, they also miss the analysis that locking in an EB-2 priority date as soon as possible should really be the priority.  I encounter so many people who are obsessing (perhaps rightfully) on EB-1 and they will spend the next 3 years building their EB-1 profile and end up with a 2027 priority date which is going to mean many years not being current as opposed to locking in a priority date in 2024 so when they file for EB-1 in 2027, they might be current.

But they don't want to listen.  That's fine.  They will realize at some point that that guy ranting on linkedin was right!

Post Date: Indian-born H-1B.  EB-2 NIW I-140 approved in 6 days via premium processing.

Master's degree in Ops Research/Systems Engineering.

Client works at a very high-profile company analyzing supply chains and modeling ways to automate processes to improve efficiency and make the company more competitive.

Client contacted me initially in January 2023 but was convinced he was "not worthy" and kept slow-walking his case.

But his H-1B clock was (is!) ticking and his employer was basically doing nothing.  

He got married in 2023 and his spouse is in H-4 and unable to work.  (Now she can get an H-4 EAD - yay!)

Client did have 2 published articles and 10+ citations per Google Scholar.

It always seemed like a decent case to me but sometimes people have it in their head that they are not good enough.  

Maybe he's the oldest child in his family.  The youngest always has a healthy sense of self.

###

Our firm had two EB-2 NIW denials in 2023 (one of which was re-filed and approved).

Since our last denial, we have had 86 straight approvals....

The hardest part of my job is just getting clients to actually believe us and not all the noise on the internet.

Of course, THIS POST IS ON THE INTERNET!  Irony.

As Axios points out, chip development and the use of AI in the space industry is expanding to address longstanding challenges. 

See article linked in the first comment below. 

Foreign nationals in the US who end up working in this domain could be well-positioned to self petition for a green card using EB-2 NIW. 

Start after you complete your Masters and while you are working on your PhD. For non-India/China born, the timing still works. 

Foreign nationals in F-1 status who are still looking for an area of growth in the economy and intellectual challenges should look at the space industry and all the start-ups involved. Some of these companies are obscure now but perhaps not in 3-4 years when you finish your Ph.D. 

What universities are aligned to feed into this industry?  Any thoughts?

Post Date: The EB-2 NIW is an increasingly popular route to pursue a green card for skilled professionals, already in the US and also abroad. 

EB-2 NIW is increasingly popular for various reasons including being able to self -petition. 

No employer is required. 

Also, the whole point of EB-2 NIW is to “waive” the slow and miserable PERM process which is what employers often have to do for a year or more before the I-140 stage. 

•••

An EB-2 NIW case is subject to review by USCIS pursuant to an administrative law case called Matter of Dhanasar.  (Google the case name to find it and read it). 

The Dhanasar case puts forward a 3-prong test for EB-2 NIW success where Prong 1 is very important for success. 

Prong 1 requires, among other things, establishing that the person seeking the EB-2 NIW approval is engaged in a proposed endeavor of “national importance.”

It turns out this is like the MOST important thing for a successful EB-2 NIW case.  

The officers get slightly obsessed about Prong 1. 

•••

One of the bizarre things that one would never intuit is that “teaching” is explicitly NOT an endeavor of “national importance.”  

See Excerpt Below. 

The officers love to cite this part of Dhanasar if you even mention teaching as part of your case. 

And yes, I understand a prohibition on teaching seems like a wrong reading of the case- but it is what it is. 

•••

In our office the way we think of this Prong 1 hostility to teaching is hostility to a “localized benefit” - if you are teaching students, then they are local and physically limited, meaning your students come from a limited geography. 

This concept also comes up for EB-2 NIW for physicians involved in patient care - localized benefit.  You are only caring for these patients in this limited area.  

(To complicate things physicians can also pursue a special patient care EB-2 NIW a/k/a P-NIW). 

•••

This “local benefit” also comes up for software professionals in some instances. They are developing software for their employer and so it is a local benefit or private benefit for the employer. 

For IT and data science people, there are potentially ways to overcome the local/private benefit concept but not always. 

For physicians, it is important to emphasize research including clinical research. 

Of course, it is fine if you teach or see patients and let me apologize for my government for having a bizarre standard that thinks those things are not of “national importance” — but we have to take the law as it is (or at least how it is being interpreted). 

So, you should just stay far away from mentioning teaching as part of your EB-2 NIW endeavor. 

Giving back to your local community will win you points for humanity but the EB-2 NIW adjudicator will hate on you.

Post Date: PERM labor certification is the main way an employer sponsors someone for a green card. 

Every PERM filing requires a 9141 prevailing wage determination. 

DOL has an epic unprecedented backlog on 9141s and no one in the Biden Administration seems to care. 

The slow 9141 processing is bad for everyone but particularly bad if -

- You are running out of H1B time (or L1 time). 

- You are running out of F1 OPT or STEM OPT - for those only eligible for OPT, it is a hopeless situation. 

- “Hopeless” includes nurses who are supposed to have a fast track for a green card.  What a mess. 

- Also tenure track faculty who are also supposed to have a special track for a green card.  Also a mess. 

I believe Brad Banias is on the verge of suing DOL about the slow 9141 processing.  Hopefully more people sue. 

When will someone high up in the Biden Administration wake up to this problem?  

— They woke up to the EB immigrant visa quota and now EB 485s are pretty fast. 

— They have tried to address slow visa appointments in India (still have work to do). 

But nothing at DOL to address backlogs except more absurd slow processing month after month. 

Things are definitely getting worse.

Post Date: EB-2 NIW approved.  Indian-born H-1B with MSEE, working for a relatively high profile company in the semiconductor industry.  This self-petitioner had ZERO publications and ZERO patents but did do 2 conference presentations while obtaining her US Master's.  She is involved in improving the production and manufacturing of solid state drives (SSDs).

###

All EB-2 NIW cases are judged against an Administrative Law case called Matter of Dhanasar (linked in the first comment below).  A key part of Matter of Dhanasar says:

"In determining whether the proposed endeavor has national importance, we consider its potential prospective impact. An undertaking may have national importance for example, because it has national or even global implications within a particular field, such as those resulting from certain improved manufacturing processes or medical advances."

What this means is that lots of professionals who are involved in "improving manufacturing processes" or "improving medical advances" can be eligible for EB-2 NIW pursuant to Matter of Dhanasar.

Of course there are other details and every case should be analyzed and prepared and positioned with rigor.

#####

The timing of this case was this: 

-- Oct 2023 = Client retains Webber Law.

-- Feb 2024 = EB-2 NIW I-140 is filed via premium processing.

-- March 2024 = EB-2 NIW I-140 is approved without RFE.

In this case, the self-petitioner is in her 5th year of H-1B time and her employer is sponsoring her for a green card through PERM but of course PERM is painfully slow.

Importantly, her husband is in his 6th year of H-1B time and his employer is also sponsoring him through PERM but clearly they are running out of time, so now there is an option for him to move to H-4 and H-4 EAD.  

Unfortunately H-4 EAD processing is annoyingly slow, but at least he can stay in the US with his family and eventually get his H-4 EAD faster than waiting for his PERM.  

(His profile is not well-suited for EB-2 NIW, in case you are wondering).

###

So many H-1B workers, including those from India, should be looking at the flexibility and optionality that having a self-petition EB-2 NIW I-140 provides.  And it is so weird that people just wait so, so long to think about this.

Does anyone think immigration law options will be better for the rest of 2024?  

How about 2025??

But there are lots of possibilities for people who are sitting around waiting for PERM while their H-1B time ticks away.

---- "Why would I want an EB-2 NIW approval when I already have a PERM-based EB-2 approval?"

Post Date: An increasing number of employers are pursuing EB-2 NIW as an alternative to PERM labor certification when sponsoring their employees for green cards.

This is good.

But it is clear to me that many law firms (including large and very famous law firms) are involved in these cases, and they really don't know what they are doing.  

This is slightly shocking in a way; then again, if you know anything about the practice of law, including how big law firms work, the idea that lawyers will pursue cases and seek payment for doing things for which they have no competence should not shock you.

###

If you are approached by your employer's lawyer about an EB-2 NIW case and you have -

** a U.S. Master's degree, or 

** Foreign equivalent of a U.S. Master's degree, or

** a U.S. Bachelor's degree + 5 years of post-Bachelor's work experience, or

** Foreign Bachelor's degree + 5 years of post-Bachelor's work experience.

THEN:  You meet the educational requirement of EB-2 NIW.  That's all that is required and you go into the 3-prong analysis of "NIW" pursuant to Matter of Dhanasar.

If you meet the standard educational requirements as listed above, you do NOT have to establish "exceptional ability" which is an alternative to the above requirements.

If your employer's lawyer is asking you for information about qualifying for "exceptional ability" but you meet the above educational requirements, you should bring this erroneous request to the attention of anyone in management or leadership at your organization who will listen.  

I bet there are people right now reading this post who have been presented with a questionnaire from their employer's law firm that incompetently asks for information that is not relevant.  These are people who work for some of the most famous companies in the world.

The "exceptional ability" criteria for EB-2 NIW is an ALTERNATIVE requirement.  

So if you see a list asking you about high salary, or evidence in a professional association, or asking about your professional licenses or certifications - but you already meet the education requirements for EB-2 NIW, you really should scream.

Read the regulations yourself.  

They are pasted below (with my lovely highlighting).

###

My hope is that at some point this post and the related screaming will make these lawyers (and their teams) more competent.  We need more competence!

Otherwise they will continue to file cases which get RFEs and potentially get denied.  And you will suffer!

And if you contact a lawyer who sends you a questionnaire with the same kind of analysis - you should also scream.  These are probably the same lawyers who will re-file your case 3 times for free:  

"Please hire our firm - we make a bowl of spaghetti and throw it against the wall 3 times for you; perhaps 1 out of the 3 times it will stick."

###

Do not be a lemming.  

Do not jump off the cliff.  

When you see the signs that your employer's lawyer is leading you off the cliff, stop and scream.

Post Date: As a reminder, people in the US on a temporary work visa like H-1B or TN or E-3 or H-1B1 --- the law permits you to have a "concurrent" employer.  

This might be a start-up company that is employing you on a part-time, hourly basis, where perhaps you are one of the co-founders.

###

For H-1Bs, the concept of "concurrent" employment has two possibly useful implications --- 

-- Some H-1B employers are exempt from the H-1B cap lottery process.  And if you get your first H-1B at this cap-exempt (lottery-exempt) employer, then the concurrent H-1B (at a private sector employer) is exempt from the cap also.  The first employer which is exempt from the cap somehow protects the second employer's H-1B filing.  So, this approach allows you to work for 2 employers and be exempt from the cap, provided your first H-1B employer was exempt from the cap.

-- Or, if you are lucky and you have gone through the lottery (win the lottery) at Employer A but now you have an opportunity to work at another private sector employer (Employer B), then the concurrent H-1B for Employer B could allow you to work for employer A and employer B at the same time.

###

In an era where getting an H-1B in the lottery is very challenging, the strategy of combining a cap-exempt employer with a cap-subject (lottery-subject) employer can be very useful.  The good people at  have the leading program to facilitate this, but these things can be structured in many ways and Open Avenues is just one way to do it.

In an era where companies of all sorts are laying off professional staff, positioning yourself with a concurrent H-1B at a start-up with your buddies could be a way to mitigate problems should your MEGATECH company decide they don't need you anymore.

-- Since January 1, 2023, our law firm has filed 18 premium process EB-2 NIW cases.

-- As of this afternoon (6/16/2023), of those 18 cases, 15 were approved without RFE, 2 were issued RFEs (we have responded and they are pending), and 1 case is still pending now (not yet reviewed).

-- Of those 18 cases filed via premium processing, the average time it took USCIS to review the filing was 13 days.  So the review time was much faster than the 45 days allocated for premium processing.

Kudos to USCIS for this.  Hopefully they can maintain this standard.

In terms of the 2 cases where we got RFEs, one of them probably deserved it and the other one - no; but whatever.  That happens.

We will also be writing more about O-1s and EB-1s.

If you know someone who is a skilled professional already in the US and looking to get a green card or perhaps abroad and looking to immigrate, encourage them to become educated about EB-2 NIW.  Things might change next year so 2024 might be a good time to get going.

We recently obtained an EB-2 NIW I-140 approval for a civil engineer.  He is in H-1B status from India and his employer was willing to sponsor him for PERM but he did not want to wait.

He spent his own money but has an I-140 approval attached to him personally.

He did have research publications and was doing fairly advanced work for a national engineering firm on a wide variety of projects including designing water treatment plants and studying strategies for more sustainable infrastructure.

###

While it is possible to succeed on EB-2 NIW cases for civil engineers who obtain a Master's degree and we have handled those, the sweet spot in my view is for people to pursue their Ph.D. and work on their EB-2 NIW case before completing their Ph.D.

The additional time for research after a Master's is valuable to build a stronger profile for an EB-2 NIW case or possibly an O-1 case if you are not lucky in the H-1B cap lottery.

The U.S. immigration system places a heavy bias in favor of formal education and if you can bear it, pursuing a Ph.D. pays off if you need to navigate the US visa and green card process.

Lots of people want to get a Master's and make some money.  But if you have to navigate U.S. immigration law, consider a few more years of beans, rice, and ramen as a grad student.

Post Date: A reminder about "visa" versus "status" --

-- Your "visa" is what you obtained at a US consulate to enter the US.  The expiration of your "visa" is NOT necessarily related to how long you can stay in the US; rather, you need a valid visa if you are abroad and want to enter the US.

-- People who enter the US in a valid visa status and stay for a long time often have a lapsed (expired) visa stamp.  That is okay.

-- Canadians, because they are such lovely people, are generally exempt from the requirement to obtain a "visa" stamped in their passport.

-- "Status" is how long you can stay in the US.  So "status" is quite important and you should ideally never overstay your "status" or you can potentially be "out of status" or accrue "unlawful presence."  The latter is particularly bad.

-- Your "status" is generally denoted by an I-94 admission record.  You can find your I-94 admission record (and travel history) online.  (Just google "I-94 record").  

-- One thing to know is that your "status" can potentially be limited by the expiration of your passport.  So you might expect an I-94 valid to 2026 because it aligns with your approval notice but your I-94 is limited to 2025 because your passport expires.  This is something you have to watch for as it can really fudge you up. (That's a technical legal term for those not familiar).

-- If you enter the US and extend your status or change your status, you may receive an I-797A with a new I-94 record attached at the bottom of the I-797A approval notice.  Because the US government uses the best technology available to cavemen, the I-94 record at the bottom of the I-797A is NOT aligned with the I-94 in the online system.  So, you could enter in F-1 status with one I-94 record online, and then change status to H-1B and your I-94 record will be on the I-797A.  The "last action" is controlling, so the I-797 supersedes the I-94 online.  Confused yet?

-- Many people get an I-94 with a cryptic expiration of "D/S" - which stands for "Duration of Stay" and then requires you to check your I-20 (if you are a F-1 student) or DS-2019 (if you are in J-1 status).

###

So much of U.S. immigration law is highly technical and easy to misunderstand.  

If you know someone who is relatively new in the US, like a student in F-1 status, encourage that person to take time to learn the rules.  The earlier a person understands some of the basic rules, the easier it will be to enjoy this great nation. 

You don't want to get bogged down in immigration law details when you have an opportunity to just sit back every day and enjoy all that the US has to offer.

2024 will be a particularly exciting year, when we choose our President, the only position in government where all US citizens get to vote.  

Because we are a serious and proud nation, we always nominate the most impressive of our citizens to hold arguably the most important job in the world.

Oh, wait?!

Post Date: Here is a timeline for an international student who has seemingly done everything right, but still might run out of time.  

I am not sure whether this will inspire or depress you.

###

-- Fall 2017 = Attends 1st semester of college in home country in Africa.

-- Jan 2018 = Obtains F1 visa and enters US for 2nd semester of college at US university #1.

-- Fall 2018 = Transfers to US university #2 (closer to relatives and cheaper to attend).

-- Completes 2018-2019 (year 2), 2019-2020 (year 3), 2020-2021 (year 4) at university #2.  Graduates!

-- Summer 2020:  Uses CPT (Curricular Practical Training) to gain 3 months of work experience in summer 2020.

-- July 2021:  Earns US Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

-- July 2021 to September 2021:  Employer #1 using OPT.

-- Sept 2021 to Feb 2022:  Employer #2 using OPT.

-- Feb 2022:  Joins Employer #3 (my client) using OPT.  So, prior to joining Employer #3, he had 6+ months of solid engineering experience in the US.

-- Aug 2022:  After 6 months of good performance, Employer #3 agrees to sponsor this international student for a green card.  Yay!

-- Aug 2022:  Employer authorizes PERM process to start.

-- Sept 2022:  Employer finalizes job description for PERM, and we file 9141 prevailing wage request.

-- April 2023:  9141 prevailing wage determination issued (finally).

###

Meanwhile, aware of how slow PERM is, in March 2023, the company agreed to try for an H-1B in the lottery.  But, like so many others, he was not selected in the lottery.  The odds of getting chosen were terrible this year!  The lottery gets worse every year.

So now we have to push ahead on PERM.  We do have one more chance for an H-1B in spring 2024 lottery.

The student's STEM OPT will expire in July 2024 and we have to clear PERM and file an I-140 and I-485 before July 2024.  Is it possible??

Given ongoing backlogs for 'all nations' per the visa bulletin, which just got worse in the very recently issued May 2023 visa bulletin, it seems unlikely that even this F-1 student who seemingly did everything right will have enough time.

Since he 'only' obtained his Bachelor's degree, the PLAN C in his case would be getting another I-20 and going back for his Master's.

So:

-- PLAN A = PERM (but that is super slow with DOL);

-- PLAN B = H-1B (but the H-1B cap odds get worse every year);

-- PLAN C = Get another I-20 and pursue a Master's while hopefully the employer keeps moving forward on PERM/I-140 - but besides the slow DOL PERM process, there is also the cut-off dates for the visa bulletin.

This is a guy who hustled and basically had a job during all the periods of time he was authorized to work.  

He found a good employer willing to sponsor him for a green card after 6 months of strong job performance.

But he still needs to have a PLAN A, a PLAN B, and a PLAN C.

Do you?

Post Date: If you have an approved I-140,

+ you are waiting for your EB priority date to be current, 

+ you are in the US, then you either --

---- (i) have already filed your I-485 application back when your priority date WAS current, or 

---- (ii) you are still waiting to file your I-485 (this is mainly where people are).

####

Varied notes:

-- If you are in the US and you hope to "adjust status" through an I-140 approval, then you need to be in a "valid nonimmigrant status" at the time you file your I-485.  This means that while you are waiting for your priority date to be current, you need to make sure you maintain a valid nonimmigrant status.  The I-140 approval does NOT confer any status.  

-- If you are in F-1 or J-1 visa status, it is NOT absolutely problematic to get a new I-20 or DS-2019 after filing an I-140, but if you have to seek a new F-1 visa or J-1 visa at a U.S. consulate, you may have issues.  So there could be a distinction between extending your status versus getting a visa.

-- More and more humanitarian parolees and asylum applicants are looking to EB immigration options, which is fine and might be better than waiting for asylum, but those people need to be careful about the requirement of filing for adjustment of status based on an EB I-140 only from a "valid nonimmigrant status."  This is a somewhat obscure rule and even good lawyers can miss it.

-- If you were fortunate to have ALREADY filed your I-485 when your priority date was current, but your p-date is no longer current, then you do NOT have to maintain a valid non-immigrant status.  

— An I-485 applicant is in the US legally & does not need an underlying, separate visa status.  

-- An EB I-485 applicant can get an EAD work permit and in many instances an AP travel permit (although the AP document may be super slow).  

-- EAD + AP documents can be extended indefinitely while an I-485 application is pending even if the underlying EB priority date is not current.  Under current rules, the EAD + AP extension govt. filing fees are waived.

-- The Visa Bulletin each month denotes the cut-off date.  The Visa Bulletin is an opaque document and adding to the complexity is the fact that the monthly Visa Bulletin publishes "two charts" --- if you have an I-485 application pending, you will only be able to get your I-485 approved if the FINAL ACTION CHART is current.  

-- Each month, USCIS has the right to choose which chart from the Visa Bulletin it will honor but this "which chart?" determination only relates to FILING an I-485 application, whereas getting an I-485 application approved is based strictly on the FINAL ACTION CHART.  

Confused yet?

###

Immigrant visa processing through the US Department of State's National Visa Center is a valid and perhaps underutilized approach for EB immigrants.  Immigrant visa processing is an alternative to I-485 adjustment of status and even if you are in the US in a temporary visa status, you are permitted to immigrant visa process.

Post Date: Machine Learning Software Engineer in H-1B status.  EB-2 NIW I-140 approved today!

He retained us at the end of Nov 2023, and we have an EB-2 NIW I-140 approval for him on this Leap Day, 2024.

He has been in H-1B status since Oct 2018.  He had changed employers 1 time (H-1B transfer) during the pandemic and his current employer has been floundering around with an EB-3 PERM case for the last 18+ months.

But in 3 months, he got an EB-2 NIW self-petition approved by putting his own money and effort into the situation.

I will admit that one of the things I liked about this client is that he was in a hurry but he was in a hurry to do EXACTLY what we told him to do.  

I probably lament this too often on this platform but WAY too many people are trying to be the chef - they have no idea what they are doing but darn it, they have watched some videos or read some discussions on telegram or talked to their cousin or the guy next door to their cousin and they know what's what and so they are going to bury you with questions and second-guessing and head fakes down various rabbit holes, rather than just do what we tell them to do.

We have very good success on our EB-2 NIW cases.  We have methodically built a team and a process.  We only take cases we can get approved.  

I wish we had more time to keep track but we have 100+ approvals in the last 2 years and really only 1 denial and that was a longshot case that we took knowing the client was a long shot.  (He was an IT consultant).

[There was a second denial which was garbage, and we did appeal - still pending at AAO, and also re-filed as an employer petition which was approved].

But it doesn't matter what your success rate is when you encounter all these know-it-alls who are going to tell you what's what and rather than just follow instructions and get their case approved, they are going to add salt and pepper or maybe throw a bucket of ketchup on the carefully prepared meal...

Kudos to the people out there who realize PERM is quicksand and they get their case assessed, pay out of pocket, and follow instructions.  Those people are winners, as they should be.

Post Date: People in L-1B visa status are permitted 5 consecutive years in the US and while they are eligible to "recapture" time spent outside the US, they are not eligible to get additional L-1B time just because they are sponsored for a green card.

The result, especially these days with Visa Bulletin cut-off dates for all nationalities in EB-2 and EB-3, is that L-1Bs of all nationalities likely need to funnel into the H-1B cap or risk having to leave the US.

Most L-1B visa holders have no idea about this and many employers also lose track of this dynamic.

People in L-1 visa status have to be increasingly vigilant in educating themselves of the US immigration system.  

If you know someone in L-1 visa status (or L-2 visa status as a spouse), encourage them to take time to learn about their status and the limitations.

Particularly brutal are the limited options available to stay in the US and work for L-1 visa holders who are laid off.

Post Date: F-1 to EB-2 NIW to green card.  Fiance abroad.  

How to do it?

-- Let's say you are in F-1 visa status and you were born in NOT India or China and you have filed an EB-2 NIW I-140 and it is approved and you had hoped that your priority date would be current by now, but it is not current.

Do I hear an "AMEN" for people in the crowd familiar with this situation?!

###

-- Let's say you are engaged and your fiance is abroad.

-- If your F-1 visa stamp in your passport is still valid, you could travel abroad and get married and return on your F-1 visa.  But if your F-1 visa stamp has expired, you run a risk that if you travel abroad and seek a new F-1 visa at the US consulate and rightfully disclose the I-140 filing, you MIGHT not get the F-1 visa and be able to return to the US.  This would obviously be a very bad thing for you.

-- For people whose F-1 visa stamp has expired and want to get married to someone abroad, and that person abroad has no way to get into the US, there is a somewhat convoluted way to file your I-485 application, get advance parole travel authorization, travel abroad and get married, and then have your wife come to the US as a follow-to-join immigrant.  

-- The way you do this is file your I-485 application and deliberately withhold something the USCIS needs to approve your I-485 application, like your medical exam results.  So, you file your I-485 application without your medical exam results.  Your I-485 filing will include an I-765 and I-131 and even though you withhold the medical exam results, USCIS should eventually approve the I-765 work permit application and I-131 travel permit application.

-- Then you use the I-131 advance parole approval to travel abroad and get married and return to the US and your marriage should occur PRIOR to your I-485 approval meaning your spouse will be a derivative dependent of your EB case.  

NOTE:  If you wait to get married after you get your green card, then your spouse will be a family-based immigrant.  But if you get married BEFORE you have your green card, then your spouse will be a derivative of your EB case.  But the key is trying to 'control' is when your I-485 will be approved.

###

This strategy is admittedly obscure and most people won't really understand what I am saying here.  But the above strategy does solve a problem that occurs and there are people who will read this and hopefully think, "A-HA."

Post Date: The beginning of September every year is the traditional start of the school year in the United States.  This year there will be many thousands of F-1 international students starting their school program.

Welcome Students!

The United States LOVES international students.  They are the cash cows that keep Higher Ed going!

Sometimes I sit in awe of an I-20 that shows tuition and expenses at like $75,000 and in the next field, it says the source is "family funds."  All over the world people are investing in their children (and grandchildren) to get an education in the United States.

This is our superpower - we attract so many talented young people.

But many F-1 international students do not have any idea how challenging it will be to stay in the United States after completing their school program.

If attracting F-1 students is our superpower, then the H-1B cap is like Kryptonite.

###

If you know a F-1 student, then please encourage them to NOW start educating themselves on their options - regarding the major they choose (definitely STEM), and positioning themselves for opportunities.  And not for opportunities of the past 10 years but rather the opportunities ahead.  

And hey, if they don't want to stay in the US after graduation, fine!  But if they do, now is the time to understand the options.

Of course, if they really, really want to stay in the US, there is always eHarmony....

Post Date: NEWS —- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced the elimination (ban) of non-compete agreements. 

See link here. 

For H-1B workers, this rule change could be significant to allow them to more easily participate in start-ups. 

If you are in H-1B status subject to a non-compete, that non-compete may no longer be enforceable. 

A few thoughts -

— An H-1B worker can be an owner or co-owner of a business in the US and that business can petition for H-1B status.  But a lot of important details should be considered. 

— This kind of H-1B can often be done well via a concurrent H-1B which helps to mitigate the prevailing wage requirements. 

— A concurrent H-1B works well for someone already in H-1B status but could also be structured as an exemption from the H-1B cap through a fellowship with Open Avenues Foundation. If you are not familiar with the structure of this kind of cap exemption, follow  for details. 

— Being part of a start-up, as a founder or co-founder, could facilitate a self-petition EB-2 NIW case as an entrepreneur. And for extremely successful ventures, perhaps EB-1A. 

— Given the ongoing “rolling recessions” in the US economy and the relatively tight labor market for many skilled professionals, going into a start-up as a founder or co-founder may be a great way to stay in the US.

Generally CPT is not available until you have completed a year of school but there is an exception, as noted, for some graduate programs.

Post Date: 9141 prevailing wage determination:  Timing update.

###

For those unfamiliar, when an employer sponsors someone for a green card, the employer must generally go through the PERM labor certification process.  PERM is a "test" of the local labor market to document a shortage of qualified and willing U.S. workers.

In order to properly "test" the local labor market, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) requires the employer to obtain a 9141 prevailing wage determination.  This determination establishes the prevailing wage for the position offered and any recruitment done must be in compliance with the prevailing wage.  

Further, at the I-140 stage (if the PERM application is approved), the employer will have to document the 'ability to pay' the wage offered which must be in compliance with the prevailing wage.

On May 9, 2023, we submitted a 9141 request to DOL for a Software Engineer.

On Oct 31, 2023, we received the 9141 determination, so the processing time for the 9141 was 175 days or 5 months + 22 days.  This is actually FASTER than earlier prevailing wage requests and perhaps is a positive sign that DOL is speeding up or perhaps is a commentary on less 9141s being submitted.

The position offered was a Software Engineer position which was slotted into the ONET category 15-1252 (Software Developer).  The position requires a Bachelor's degree + 5 years of specialized technical experience.  DOL designated the job in the Level IV prevailing wage.

The 9141 determination is valid until June 30, 2024, so in theory the employer could use the same 9141 determination for other cases in the coming months but the position offered would have to be the same, including the same job requirements (minimum requirements).

PERM continues to be ridiculously slow and the possible US government shutdown in less than 3 weeks makes me nervous but definitely nice to see a 9141 determination come through in less than 6 months (albeit just barely).

Post: 2022-07-15 03:52:11
Post Date: In EB (Employment-Based) immigration law, certain questions that seem straightforward can be surprisingly convoluted.  

One example:  
"When can our H-1B transfer candidate start?"

###

From a legal perspective, the candidate can start when the H-1B transfer petition is FILED.  This is known as H-1B portability.  An immigration lawyer can usually provide pretty good visibility on the timing of the filing.

But some candidates will not feel comfortable giving notice until the H-1B is filed.  And some candidates will not feel comfortable giving notice until the H-1B is APPROVED.

The timing of the H-1B approval will depend on whether the case is filed via premium processing (always recommended) or not.

So, the start date will depend on when the candidate feels comfortable giving notice.

###

Another complication is if the candidate plans to travel abroad between jobs which is sometimes a tempting thing to do but can create complications.

Another complication occurs commonly in physicians who want a gap between when they start at EMPLOYER B, that is, they will stop working at EMPLOYER A on let's say June 30 but they want to start at EMPLOYER B in August but they don't want to travel abroad and they don't want gaps in their status and they don't want gaps in their driver's license privileges.  One practice pointer is that it is NOT unlawful benching if the candidate requests extra time off to relocate or for other personal/family reasons.  

###

While it is slightly tedious, the issue of "when can the candidate start?" is a bespoke (case-by-case) consideration.  Alas, it is almost surely not when the hiring manager wants the candidate to start - 

-- YESTERDAY....

Post Date: Employment-Based (EB) immigration.
Self-petitioning risk management.

###

Everyone who needs a green card would like to get a green card through the EB-1A process.  Apart from marrying a US citizen, EB-1A is the fastest way to get a green card and does not require an employer (even though EB-1A is not very fast for Indian-born candidates now, but that is a different sad, ridiculous story for another day).

If you knew in advance that for sure you could get EB-1A, then you definitely should pursue EB-1A.  

But most commonly, people who want EB-1A are not sure whether their case will be approved.  

Well, at least they should be "not sure" if they knew how things worked.  Occasionally you meet someone with a lot of confidence and ignorance, and they don't know what they don't know.  But I digress.

###

Many reasonable people think:  I will go for EB-1A and if that is not successful, then I will try for EB-2 NIW.

In my view, that's bass-ackwards.

If you file under EB-1A and you fail, it could take many months even if you file with premium processing.  A denied petition means there would be a RFE (Request for Evidence) or NOID (Notice of Intent to Deny) and those require time to prepare a response.

And here's a pro-tip:  The USCIS adjudicators for EB-1A cases who review premium processing cases do appear stricter than those who review regular, non-premium processing cases, at least based on anecdotal experience, but non-premium processing cases are SLOW.

[Another pro-tip is to try to file for review by Texas, not Nebraska].

So, if you go for EB-1A via regular, non-premium processing and you fail for EB-1A, and you decide to go with EB-2 NIW, you will be getting into the "slow lane" several months later.

Whereas if you file your EB-2 NIW case first and get it approved, you have locked in your spot in the slow lane and then you can 'stretch' for EB-1A knowing you at least already have your spot in the slow lane locked in.

[Note:  You could file both at the same time and I can be persuaded that has merit.]

###

Now, a critique of the above approach might be, "Sure, the lawyer wants you to file two things rather than 1 thing to make more money."

I have no real response to that critique, but I have seen lots of EB-1A denials - people who contact me after their EB-1A case was denied, and some of those people have screwed up their lives going for EB-1A when they were not eligible, including the most famous EB-1A loser, Dr. Kazarian (which was not my case).

###

In general, the issue with lawyers (and consultants and notaries and gurus) in the immigration system is not those who want to proceed cautiously and methodically but rather those who have 'quick fixes'. 

“It is distressing how many good people—including the highly educated and the minimally educated —fall prey to disreputable lawyers known to the immigration system"

– Excerpt of Footnote 1, Concurrence of 9th Circuit Judge Pregerson, in Kazarian v. USCIS, 596 F.3d 1115 (2010)

Post Date: Two "best practices for life" - 

FIRST:  Which I had to teach my texting children - Emails should have subject lines and you can change the subject line to reflect the current discussion.

SECOND:  If you are sent a list of documents to gather up, or questions to answer - by a lawyer or a doctor or an accountant or a business colleague ----------- review the list in its entirety and then make a list of questions that you have, versus asking 1 question and 1 question and 1 question.

There are a million reasons this is more sensible including the fact that you might find the answer to your question by reading the whole document.

Hopefully that lawyer/doctor/accountant is also operating the same way and has sent you a long list of things that he/she needs for your situation as you will probably be annoyed if that person asks you for 1 thing and then 2 days later for another thing and then 3 days later for 2 more things.

I once had to fire a potential insurance salesman who seemed incapable of understanding this basic principle of how busy people operate.  Every week he wanted me to sign another form.  He clearly did not know how to do his job.  

No one wants to get peppered with 1 thing and then 3 hours later another thing.

In life, when dealing with other professionals, consider the 'transaction time' of your engagement with them.  People are not generally in a running chat with you as their only exclusive responsibility, unless you are paying a fortune for someone to represent you hourly.  Then they probably love your inefficiency.

Oh, another thing:  Hourly billing = inefficiency = profits.

Post Date: Regarding H-1B and L-1 time and the concept of "recapture."

-- If you have been selected in the H-1B cap lottery and your employer is filing an I-129 petition for you now, then if the H-1B (I-129) petition is approved, the validity period will generally start on October 1.

-- New H-1Bs start generally on October 1 because October 1 is the start of the US government's fiscal year.  So that is when the H-1B annual allotment is replenished.  

-- Traditionally the H-1B cap filings were April 1 to be effective October 1 as you could file an I-129 petition six months in advance of the validity period.  The system is slightly muddled now that USCIS is using the electronic registration system.

-- If you are in the US in F-1 visa status and your I-129 petition was filed as a "change of status" petition, then you will automatically move into H-1B status on October 1.  

-- If you are abroad, then you need to get an H-1B visa stamped in your passport (unless you are Canadian and visa-exempt), and then you will enter the US.  Your first date in the US is the start of your H-1B time unless you enter in the 10 days prior to October 1, as the earliest date is October 1.  (The rules permit someone to enter 10 days prior to the start of their validity period and visas are annotated accordingly).  

-- So, if you are abroad and do not enter the US in H-1B status until December 1, then your H-1B six years starts on December 1, not October 1.

-- An H-1B visa holder is permitted 6 consecutive years in the US but the rules permit the H-1B visa holder to "recapture" any days spent outside the US.  

-- As noted in the memo attached here, a "DAY" is construed to mean a full 24 hours so partial days (Travel Days) outside the US will not be recaptured and will NOT be eligible to be added back to the total maximum period.  See Footnote 3.

-- Time spent in H-4 visa status will not count towards the 6-year limit.

-- L-1A visa holders get 7 years along the same lines, and L-1B visa holders get 5 years along the same lines.

-- Importantly, the durational limits for L-1 (5 years of L-1B and 7 years for L-1A) CANNOT be extended under current law based on starting the green card process, whereas if you have H-1B visa status, you can get additional H-1B time beyond the 6 year limit if the green card process has been started and either -

----- (i) over 365 days have passed since a PERM application (9089) was filed for you; or 

----- (ii) you have an approved I-140 petition and your priority date is not current.

-- The extension beyond 6 years based on a green card process is a separate concept from recapture.

-- The concept of recapture is an important one in 2024 in light of how people lived during the pandemic as often people spent a lot of time out of the US during 2020 and 2021.

-- To document time outside the US, you can use your passport stamps, your I-94 travel history, and ideally airline itineraries and an affidavit to attest to time outside the US.

-- Back in Oct 2023, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order related to AI (Artificial Intelligence).

-- A Fact Sheet included this statement:  "Use existing authorities to expand the ability of highly skilled immigrants and nonimmigrants with expertise in critical areas to study, stay, and work in the United States by modernizing and streamlining visa criteria, interviews, and reviews."

-- This was a good thing for various reasons but of course now 'everyone' is claiming to be an expert in AI.  Come on!

-- If you are trying to file something like an EB-2 NIW case or an O-1 case or an EB-1A case, you need to be credible.  You can't just use buzzwords and platitudes.  USCIS officers see references to AI all the time now and they probably just gloss over them.

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING in any EB immigration filing is credibility.  If your filing has statements that are not believable, you are doomed.

We are not necessarily seeing a difference in adjudication standards between premium versus regular processing EB-2 NIW cases.

This client has a US Master's degree in Medical Lab Science and co-authored 2 peer-reviewed publications (7 citations total).

The challenge in this case, I think, is that the client works at a consulting firm and was placed on-site in support of research at a national/international life sciences company.

But the self-petitioning client is involved in supporting cancer research, so the work is clearly in a domain of national importance.

In general, it is better to work directly at the 'big famous company' but if you work at a consulting firm with a contractual relationship with the 'big famous company' - there are potentially ways to document your distinctive contributions in ways that demonstrate your value.

It is CRITICAL for green card holders to know:  If you spend long periods outside the United States as a green card holder, then you can risk losing your green card.  

It is counter-intuitive but if you have H-1B status, you could go abroad for 18 months and return on your H-1B visa without issue.  But if you have a green card and you go abroad for 18 months, you will likely have a HUGE problem.

Like everything in US immigration law, the rules associated with losing your green card can be complicated to analyze; but one thing is true:

-- If you plan to spend an extended period of time out of the US as a green card holder, OR if you plan to spend a lot of time out of the US (like multiple trips in one year), it can be useful to obtain a re-entry permit.

Now, someone might tell you that a re-entry permit is not 'really required' if you return to the US every 11 months, and as a technical matter that may be true but if you have ever been interrogated at the airport by a US Customs officer, perhaps with your family including small children, after an extended period out of the US, you will not wish that on anyone.

A re-entry permit is a prophylactic.  

Even the receipt for the re-entry permit application can be useful to hold the US Customs officer at bay if they seem fired up to take your green card away.

Applying for a re-entry permit application is not necessarily hard.  You can find the form online at .  It is Form I-131.

Post Date: The March 2024 Visa Bulletin has been issued by the US Department of State.  You can find it linked in the first comment below.

I think most people (including many attorneys) look at the Visa Bulletin and they have no idea what is happening.  

Here is my best explanation of the February to March Visa Bulletin movement for EB1 and EB2 and EB3 immigrants -

-- First, you have to know that each month there are two charts.  While this is not the absolute precise detailed explanation, roughly speaking "Chart B" allows people to file I-485 applications and "Chart A" determines which I-485 applications already filed can be approved.  (I realize immigration nerds are going to object to this description, but I think this explanation roughly does the trick).

-- Note also that Chart A determines which people can get immigrant visa interviews at US consulates abroad.  It is my feeling that in recent years more EB immigrants are processing from abroad.

-- For Chart B, from Feb 2024, to March 2024, there is no movement at all for EB-1 and EB-2 and EB-3 for ANY nationality.  

-- What this means is that the US government is telling you that they already have enough cases right now and they don't think they need any more pending cases to reach the annual limit of approvals by the end of the fiscal year (9/30/24).  Now they may realize later in the fiscal year that they mis-calculated and if they realize this, then they could potentially move the dates forward for Chart B.  

-- Chart B is super important because everyone watches to file their I-485 and Chart B disappoints, month after month.

-- For Chart A, from February 2024, to March 2024, there has been modest movement in certain categories:

---- India EB1 moved from Sept 1, 2020, to Oct 1, 2020.

---- China EB-1 moved from July 1, 2022, to July 15, 2022.

---- ROW (Rest of World) EB-2 and EB-3 also moved forward by a week.

What that is telling you:

-- The LACK of movement in Chart B is telling you the government thinks they already have enough I-485s in the system (already filed) that they don't need any more filed; and

-- The MODEST movement in EB-1 India and EB-1 China and EB-2 ROW and EB-3 ROW is that the US government is trying to slowly move the dates forward and approve more cases so that they reach the annual limit of EB green cards they can approve.

Traditionally, for certain technical reasons, there is often MORE movement in October, then January, then April, then July.  (It is the first month of the quarter starting with October which is the first month of the fiscal year).

I am not saying anything super interesting will happen in April but traditionally April has been a more interesting month than February or March.

###

Overall, the system continues to be frustrating and it is fascinating to see the Pakistanis and the Nepalis and the Iranians and the Nigerians and the Turks start to understand what the Indians and Chinese have known for a long, long time.

Post Date: In recent weeks I have been contacted by several people who live and work outside the United States and are interested in EB-2 NIW.

These are professionals who have never been to the United States.

While traditionally not common, it is possible to petition for a green card from abroad using EB-2 NIW.  It is not particularly fast and not everyone is eligible, but it might be the best option for someone who thinks their career will benefit from being able to live and work in the United States.

I will say that one other category that is coming up a lot recently are people who are in the US now but anticipate going abroad (because their temporary visa status runs out or because of personal/family/professional reasons) but want to return in a couple years.  EB-2 NIW could work well for those people.

###

With these people in mind, I have written an updated primer on EB-2 NIW for people who are trying to understand it, at a "101" level - although it dawns on me now that using Dwight from the Office in a meme might not be the right theme for a global audience.

Then again, President Biden has brought Scranton to the world!

Post Date: As a reminder, people in the US on a temporary work visa like H-1B or TN or E-3 or H-1B1 --- the law permits you to have a "concurrent" employer.  

This might be a start-up company that is employing you on a part-time, hourly basis, where perhaps you are one of the co-founders.

###

For H-1Bs, the concept of "concurrent" employment has two possibly useful implications --- 

-- Some H-1B employers are exempt from the H-1B cap lottery process.  And if you get your first H-1B at this cap-exempt (lottery-exempt) employer, then the concurrent H-1B (at a private sector employer) is exempt from the cap also.  The first employer which is exempt from the cap somehow protects the second employer's H-1B filing.  So, this approach allows you to work for 2 employers and be exempt from the cap, provided your first H-1B employer was exempt from the cap.

-- Or, if you are lucky and you have gone through the lottery (win the lottery) at Employer A but now you have an opportunity to work at another private sector employer (Employer B), then the concurrent H-1B for Employer B could allow you to work for employer A and employer B at the same time.

###

In an era where getting an H-1B in the lottery is very challenging, the strategy of combining a cap-exempt employer with a cap-subject (lottery-subject) employer can be very useful.  The good people at Open Avenues Foundation have the leading program to facilitate this, but these things can be structured in many ways and Open Avenues is just one way to do it.

In an era where companies of all sorts are laying off professional staff, positioning yourself with a concurrent H-1B at a start-up with your buddies could be a way to mitigate problems should your MEGATECH company decide they don't need you anymore.

Post Date: NEWS —- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced the elimination (ban) of non-compete agreements. 

See link here. 

For H-1B workers, this rule change could be significant to allow them to more easily participate in start-ups. 

If you are in H-1B status subject to a non-compete, that non-compete may no longer be enforceable. 

A few thoughts -

— An H-1B worker can be an owner or co-owner of a business in the US and that business can petition for H-1B status.  But a lot of important details should be considered. 

— This kind of H-1B can often be done well via a concurrent H-1B which helps to mitigate the prevailing wage requirements. 

— A concurrent H-1B works well for someone already in H-1B status but could also be structured as an exemption from the H-1B cap through a fellowship with Open Avenues Foundation. If you are not familiar with the structure of this kind of cap exemption, follow Danielle Goldman for details. 

— Being part of a start-up, as a founder or co-founder, could facilitate a self-petition EB-2 NIW case as an entrepreneur. And for extremely successful ventures, perhaps EB-1A. 

— Given the ongoing “rolling recessions” in the US economy and the relatively tight labor market for many skilled professionals, going into a start-up as a founder or co-founder may be a great way to stay in the US.

Besides the US, I know there are very talented Vietnamese in Australia, UK, Canada (of course), Taiwan, South Korea.

Post Date: "EB-2 NIW" is a way for skilled professionals to self-petition for a green card without an employer.

To qualify for EB-2 NIW, an individual must have either -

-- (i) a Master's degree (US or foreign), or 

-- (ii) a Bachelor's degree (US or foreign) plus 5 years of documented post-Bachelor's work experience, or 

-- (iii) "exceptional ability" as documented by specific regulatory criteria.

###

If an individual meets the threshold education requirements above, then the individual must satisfy the 3-prong test laid out in Matter of Dhanasar, an administrative law case published in December 2016 (at the end of the Obama Administration).

To bolster Matter of Dhanasar, the Biden Administration has issued policy guidance (what I call the Dhanasar Force Multipliers).  The Dhanasar Force Multipliers policy guidance help articulate what qualifies as an endeavor of national importance, which is one of the key parts of analyzing Dhanasar.

The Force Multiplier memos in essence make it easier to get approved for EB-2 NIW.

###

With the above in mind, it is noteworthy at the Biden Administration's Department of Energy has just released $6 billion in funding to support industrial projects to reduce carbon missions.  These projects seek to reduce carbon emissions in wide swaths of the economy including the manufacturing of construction materials.  

The funding supports decarbonization efforts in the following industries:

- Iron
- Steel
- Cement & concrete
- Aluminum
- Chemicals
- Food & Beverage
- Pulp & Paper

Apparently 80% of the projects funded are in disadvantaged communities that have experience years of disinvestment.  (Something useful in documenting Dhanasar eligibility).

Further information about the huge federal financial support of these projects can be found in items linked in the comments below.

###

If you are a foreign national in the US in F-1 visa status or H-1B visa status or another temporary visa status, or frankly if you are a foreign national ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD with skills and experience relevant to the above, you might have a viable EB-2 NIW case.

Certainly engineers and other skilled professionals working at the specific companies funded by the DOE have potentially strong arguments that their work is of national importance.

###

EB-2 NIW remains an attractive option even for those who have an approved PERM-based I-140 as EB-2 NIW immigrant visa petitions (I-140s) can be filed as self-petitions versus PERM-based I-140s which are tied to (i) employer, and (ii) position, and (iii) location.  

Also, EB-2 NIW I-140s are eligible for premium processing for faster decision-making versus the very slow PERM labor certification process.  

Individuals with existing priority dates should be able to RETAIN those priority dates if they pursue EB-2 NIW.

Post Date: Since Sept 2021, when I started my current firm, we have filed 199 EB-2 NIW I-140s.

Of those 199 -- 130 were approved without a RFE (Request for Evidence).

Of those 199 -- 10 were approved after a RFE.

[See Comment 1 below].

Of the 10 cases approved after a RFE, one approval came recently.

In that case, the self-petitioning client was a F-1 who obtained a STEM doctorate and was working at a private sector employer when we started his case.  While we were working on his case, he got a job offer to become a professor at a university.

So, we had prepared the case focused on his private sector job and then close to the time of filing, we were advised about the new job and we tried to update things to clarify the new direction for his career.

Clearly our efforts to provide this nuance in the petitioner cover letter confused the reviewing officer at USCIS and it seems like the RFE (Request for Evidence) was issued based on this confusion.

In our RFE response, we were able to clarify the situation such that the EB-2 NIW I-140 was approved.  

But a couple things are worth mentioning about this experience -

1.  When any case is approved by USCIS, the USCIS does not provide you with written commentary on what was useful and persuasive and what was not.  You just get an approval notice.  This requires lawyers to basically guess at what they did that was persuasive.  This means that lawyers who are honest have a certain level of humility.  It also means that the people out there who are saying that they know exactly what is persuasive are probably lying.  You certainly know nothing from one case.  You may have gotten lucky.  If you are involved in several cases, you will know more.

2.  In an EB-2 NIW filing and basically in any kind of filing with USCIS, it is important to be DETAILED and PRECISE but not necessarily NUANCED.  You want to be detailed because USCIS officers, I believe, see a lot of filings that look like they were prepared by ChatGPT and as a result, they do not convey credible and persuasive detail.  But if you are too nuanced, the officers don't seem to like that.

In the case I have in mind, we tried to explain that he had been working at Employer A doing X, Y, Z and that he was going to become a professor and continue studying similar issues but in an academic context, and also that he would be doing some teaching.

We were apparently good enough at explaining the detail in the RFE response but in the initial filing, our attempt at nuance seemed to be off-putting to the officer.

This is one reason I push back on the idea of filing EB-2 NIW cases while unemployed.  It is one thing to be unemployed and finishing graduate school where your career is just starting, but if you are mid-career and unemployed and you are left saying, "well, I could do this or I could do that.  A little bit of this and a little bit of that."

That's not good.  

It is the kind of thing that might make Christopher Walken dance on the table.  And fly.

Post Date: Is Europe in decline?

The case is made that the EU’s percentage of global GDP has gone down over the last 10+ years and that talented people are moving away (brain drain). 

But the cities of Europe are the most livable in the world. 

— Are livable cities often a sign of decline?  That is very paradoxical. 

— Or maybe Europe is not on the decline at all and they are investing big in infrastructure. The bold claim has been made that Euro investment in infrastructure is more than the US and India combined. 

The US is definitely investing big in infrastructure. One of the rare areas of bipartisan agreement with the economy. 

•••

In our law practice we have been fortunate to represent a wide range of Europeans seeking to immigrate in the US. Many have longstanding European heritage while others are from Africa and the Middle East who immigrated first to Europe for school and want to move again. 

•••

Where people want to live and build their careers and raise their families is very individualized.  

Many people of course envision their best opportunity to be in the US. 

Unfortunately the US immigration system provides very limited viable options. 

— Europeans who come to the US as students can often transition from students to green cards. 

— Getting transferred on L-1 and E-2 visas is also a route to be here at least temporarily. 

•••

Entrepreneurs and STEM-based professionals generally have the best chance to self-petition for a green card, either waiting in Europe for the process or coming first on a temporary visa.

March is just 2 weeks away!

Employers who wish to sponsor H-1B workers in the lottery have to register.  The registration is for employers who have not previously registered or whose contact person and email address have changed from last year.

The registration period for employers begins on February 21, 2023, at Noon Eastern.

-- For some things in U.S. immigration law, I think it is important to do it right away.  

-- In other things in U.S. immigration law, I think it is best to wait until Day 2.  

In this, I favor waiting until Day 2.

Let the system crash on Day 1 and don't pull out your hair.  

Just work on this on Feb 22.

After all, USCIS doesn't have H-1B workers maintaining their IT, which is why it doesn't work very well...

Post Date: US immigration law is NOT a static area of law.  It is very dynamic.

Things change.

Occasionally there are people who learn about something, then they vanish and come back 6 months later or 12 months later and they want to do X, but things are different from when they initially learned about it.

One of the big things that has changed in the last few years is that getting a green card through employment-based immigration can take much longer.

Whereas in the "good old days" the scammers could tell you to enter on a B visa and file an EB-2 NIW I-140/I-485 with a business plan claiming you will build low income housing and "VOILA" ....

Now the scammers tell you to come on a B visa, change to F-1 and file an EB-2 NIW with the same silly business plan but they tell you that you must wait for your I-485 while you are landlocked and they tell you the reason there is a delay is because they (the scammers) are so awesome and so many people have succeeded in their schemes; but your EB-2 NIW case is probably garbage but the lady selling you the plan is very pretty, so there's that.

###

But I digress. 

Why are things taking longer?

It is because there are annual limits (quotas) and there is huge demand against the annual limits and to the credit of the Biden Administration, they have actually been processing the final stage employment-based green card filings quickly, meaning that they are reaching the annual limit quickly.

It is harder to FILE an EB I-485 but those who do file are seeing fast review of the filings.

Fast review of EB I-485s means faster use of the annual allotment of EB green cards.

Further, because of an anomaly during the pandemic (and immediately after the pandemic), there were more EB (Employment-Based) green cards available to issue every fiscal year, that is, there were a few years where the allotment was very large; but now it is trending back to the normal limit, but demand remains high.

What is going to change this dynamic?  No one knows.

But it is probably safe to assume the process will keep getting longer.

Post Date: O-1 (and EB-2 NIW) for Software Engineers.  Regarding GitHub contributions.

The temporary visa category of O-1 is rightfully getting more attention given the challenges of the H-1B cap.  More F-1 students are looking at an O-1 as a possible alternative to H-1B.  This is particularly important for Indian and Chinese born immigrants who cannot realistically self-petition for a green card and get any work authorization given the long waits of the Visa Bulletin cut-off dates.

An O-1 requires employer sponsorship and employers sometimes dissemble in their consideration of O-1.  This is particularly true at large employers who use certain law firms that are really efficient at pushing everyone into H-1B and PERM.

One mistake I see is that people wait until AFTER losing the H-1B cap lottery their last time and then scrambling to try for O-1.  

In my view this is 'too late' - and what you want to be doing is preparing your O-1 profile (and maybe explicitly your O-1 case) during your F-1 OPT and STEM OPT period so if you are unlucky in the H-1B cap lottery, you are ready to go for O-1.

A lot of F-1 students study software engineering and data science, which were probably the right fields to choose 10 years ago and maybe 5 years ago but maybe not the right fields for the 2024 job market.  

Besides the challenging job market, software engineers and data scientists often face headwinds in trying to get approved for O-1 as their fields are not necessarily well-suited for the O-1 criteria.  [A link to the official USCIS policy manual for O-1 is in the first comment below].

Contributions to GitHub can possibly be one way to demonstrate subject matter expertise, of relevance to O-1 but also EB-2 NIW and potentially even EB-1A.  

In general the challenge faced by software engineers and data scientists and data analysts is that they are hyper-focused on making their employers more efficient and profitable.  Those are very useful activities for any organization but those things may not necessarily be useful in meeting the O-1 criteria, or showcasing an endeavor of national importance for EB-2 NIW.

Besides 'waiting too long' on F-1 OPT and STEM OPT, and besides 'studying the wrong thing' (which no one really wants to hear) -- the other mistake I am seeing is people moving into Day 1 CPT and thinking this solves a problem.  

Day 1 CPT is a band-aid.  

It buys you another chance at the lottery but next year's odds in the lottery will also be bad.  What people need to be doing is using their time to get out of the H-1B cap lottery nonsense and the only way to do that (other than moving abroad and returning on L-1, or maybe marrying a US citizen) is trying to build a profile for O-1.

I do think Day 1 CPT is a possible short-term solution for people but way too many people are pursuing it now and the odds of winning the H-1B cap lottery next year will be as bad or worse than this year.

You need to do something much more substantial.

Post Date: When will the July 2024 Visa Bulletin be issued?  

No one knows which gives you a quick understanding of how completely unserious the US government is about the entire immigration system.

The Visa Bulletin is an important monthly report that impacts millions of people and their families and their employers.

###

Each month investors and Wall Street and the financial news media know precisely when the jobs numbers and unemployment figures will be released.  Same goes for the CPI/inflation information.  There is a whole precise schedule for these things and the government absolutely never misses the schedule.  There would be hell to pay if they simply issued it a few days late 'just because.'

But when it comes to something like the Visa Bulletin, which is issued every month and then followed by the clownish USCIS "which chart to honor for I-485s" - they just do it whenever they feel like it.  

The whole way the US government runs the immigration system is just an embarrassment.  Yes - the laws are bad and outdated and that's a big problem but the whole ADMINISTRATION of the system is totally low grade and not worthy of a great nation.

But we accept it because we know that immigration is just some kind of backwater.

There is absolutely no reason why the US Department of State cannot simply create a calendar and say that the Visa Bulletins will be issued on these precise dates for the fiscal year and then list out the dates, the same way the US Department of Labor issues the jobs numbers.

Does anyone even ask about this?  Maybe the thousands of immigration professionals at the AILA conference next week can ask why everything is so unplanned?

I suppose we will hear about how hard their lives are - these government workers.  They cannot possibly have a schedule.

Is knowing the unemployment rate more important than millions of people worldwide waiting to find out if they can immigrate?  

The only reason there is no set schedule is that the US government agencies involved in managing immigration have such contempt for the public whereas the investor class and the financial media and everything built around financial data is released in a rigorous and timely way because the US government cares a lot about Wall Street and could care less about the millions of people and their employers (and their lawyers!) 

And this is the kind of treatment we get now - with an Administration who in theory has a pro-immigration outlook.  

Next year they might just decide not to issue the Visa Bulletin.  I mean, that's even more effective than a ban on asylum, right?  

(Kidding - or am I?)

Post Date: USCIS is an unserious organization.  We all know this but we just go along with the charade.

One example:  An I-539 can be filed online.  Fine.

But if an I-539 is filed by mail, the mailroom can reject the filing for lack of a proper signature.

(And of course the ability to reject filings for improper signatures includes the ability to IMPROPERLY reject filings that have CORRECT signatures).

But why are they rejecting anything based on the signature if the whole form can be filed online with no signature at all?

###

A serious organization that actually has some clue about how to serve the public would try to align its services to some sense of reality.

But we just continue this charade and of course we have had 3+ years of leadership that in theory is trying to be reasonable but simply incapable of it. 

And we are on the verge of going into a new Administration where all the nonsense will be a feature, not a bug.

Our presentation is entitled, "Mistakes were Made:  How to Identify and Mitigate Errors in Immigration Law Practice."

###

I appreciate the conference planners for supporting our idea for this topic because I don't think lawyers do enough of reviewing and considering mistakes.  Physicians have very specific procedures for considering mistakes (M&M conference).

I know MBA types and management consultants are always doing case studies to review things that went wrong.  But lawyers seem to be really averse to this.  As if we are all infallible.  Perhaps that relates to the high level of chemical abuse issues in our field!  (Only half-joking).

And of all the areas of law, I would argue that immigration law is the area of law where there is the least amount of grace/mercy in the system.  Errors can be devastating to clients, including things that are incredibly technical and non-material.

Post Date: NIW = PIW (National Interest = Public Interest).

Whenever I talk about a National Interest Waiver, I am quick to refer to it as a Public Interest Waiver.  Otherwise, I say or write the word "national interest" and I hear the distinctive voice of Henry Kissinger and think, 'yeah, that's not it'.'

Marco Scanu recently commented that NIW is a bit like USCIS asking:

-- "Why should the US care what you have to offer?" or 

-- "What's in it for the US?"

I think that is correct.  

The Prong 1 of Matter of Dhanasar is getting at this idea.  There are certain 'endeavors' that have 'national importance'.  Of course, there are many endeavors which are perfectly reasonable and good but simply don't have 'national importance.'

But I think it is useful to use the term "public interest" which I believe is actually more accurate than "national interest" which slightly implies something involving the army.

###

Separate from this idea of public interest -- one thing people get wrong is that they think WORDS will persuade the officer.  

Whereas the Biblical James might say, "Faith without works is dead" - the USCIS officer is likely to say "Words without evidence is a denial."

You can't just paper the file with your words and win.  You have to provide evidence to supplement your words.  

What is good evidence?  That depends on your situation.  

But it would be a mistake to think that you can show up in a lawyer's office and say, "Poof, make me into a successful EB-2 NIW candidate."

In general I like analogies that compare law practices to restaurants but importantly EB-2 NIW is not like something on the menu that you can just order and get.  "I'll take an EB-2 NIW, premium process, with a side salad."  

That's just not how it works.

Post Date: A super reasonable question that is posed almost daily to immigration lawyers is "how long will it take for me to get my green card?"  -- but it is often very hard (if not impossible) for the lawyer to say.

And there is a lot of misunderstanding associated with this question.  People confuse processing times at USCIS with cut-off dates on the Visa Bulletin.  They see a cut-off date from Feb 2022 so they assume it will take 18 months.  All of this is just wrong thinking.

###

I think a comparable question is when someone asks their financial planner, "how long until I have enough saved to retire?" -- similar to the question of how long will the green card take, there are just lots of factors that make the retirement question a difficult thing to answer.  Have you ever used a retirement calculator on the internet?  You can juice the variables and get any answer you want.

###

But it turns out that one thing is true in almost all cases when going for a green card AND saving for retirement - the sooner you start, the better off you will be.

So 7 days.

Self-petitioning client is a Vietnamese born post-doc in Singapore, interested in the semiconductor industry.  

Retainer agreement signed February 20, 2023.

4 months from the start of the case to approved I-140.

###

This year we have represented an engineering professor in Nigeria (in Nigeria), a "white hat" hacker from the Middle East (based there) - both cases approved.

We have recently been retained by two African STEM professionals living in Europe.  All are EB-2 NIW self-petitioning clients.

Yes, EB2 will still take 12+ months to complete with the I-140 (even premium) and immigrant visa process, but if you think your best professional opportunities are in the US, the Biden Administration's combination of promoting EB-2 NIW for STEM professionals and allowing for premium processing for EB-2 NIW has created an unprecedented opportunity.

In some of these cases, we encourage the candidates to handle immigrant visa processing (final stage processing) on their own as that process can get pretty expensive particularly if there is a family involved.

In my view, immigrant visa processing through the National Visa Center (NVC) is definitely "doable" without an attorney for a professional who is diligent and follow instructions with 'no issues.'

Our clients do get 'freebie' help here and there when they handle NVC processing on their own.

###

I definitely hope things get better for Indian-born and China-born candidates but in the meantime, EB-2 NIW remains an option for talented STEM professionals worldwide to self-petition.

-- Our firm converted several pending EB2 NIW I-140s from regular to premium processing on Jan 30.

-- We filed the conversion requests on 1/30 to arrive at USCIS on 1/31.

-- Because of weather issues, our conversion requests did not arrive at USCIS until Feb 3.

-- We received one receipt notice by email on Feb 7 from the Nebraska Service Center, but we did not receive any email receipts (yet) on the other cases.

-- We used a credit card to pay for all the conversion requests (USCIS filing fees).

My best guess is that we will see relatively fast processing on the conversion cases and that regular, non-premium process cases filed in Feb 2023 and beyond will move slow; but we have seen amazingly fast processing of EB2 NIW I-140s filed in October/November 2022 - approvals coming every day it seems!

-- For years, there was a push to get more people to pursue Computer Science.  "We need more coders."  And so young people dutifully pursued that kind of education.  Some even went to "boot camps."  You know, people who obtained useless degrees like Political Science went to places where they pretended to like math and learned to code.

-- Certainly many, many international students came to the US to get often Master's degrees in Computer Science.

-- Recently, for a variety of reasons (including AI, Elon Musk showing us Twitter can run with thousands fewer people, higher interest rates making pet projects at companies unsustainable, etc.) -- the market for people with CS degrees seems to be very tough.

-- We have had clients (employers) try to proceed on PERM filings and are now getting HUNDREDS of applicants.  Increasingly employers are not able to proceed on PERM filings because of qualified and willing US workers.  This doesn't mean they will lay off their existing H-1B worker but it does put into question how those people will get green cards.

-- If you are a F-1 student and have yet to graduate or maybe you are on the cusp of graduating, and you majored in CS or maybe an adjacent field like Data Science, you might need to swallow this reality and consider whether you need to stay in school (or return to school) and obtain education in a field more aligned with the job market of 2024, not 2016.

Alas, you cannot get an H-1B for carpentry.

I do not generally link to the newsletter articles since Linkedin traditionally 'throttles' links to substack.  (That seems lame and short-sighted, but what do I know).

So, if you see this post - consider yourself lucky!

-- PERM Labor Certification.

-- EB-2 NIW.

-- O-1s and L-1s and EB-1s.

-- Transfers to Canada and elsewhere.

Post Date: The Biden Administration could issue a USCIS policy memo tomorrow making clear all public school districts in the US are exempt from the H-1B cap through an assumed affiliation with a college and university and then match F-1 students who were H-1B cap lottery losers with teaching opportunities.

That would fill many thousands of job openings and allow talented people to stay in the US, admittedly not in their preferred occupation but it could at least become a new pathway.

Post Date: If you are in H-1B status and you are married and your spouse is also in H-1B status and you are laid off, you can go into H-4 status and it will not impact your ability to get H-1B status later and be exempt from the H-1B cap lottery.  (Assuming your current H-1B was subject to the lottery).

A lot of people seem to be totally allergic to H-4 status as if they are radioactive if they touch it.  That is not true and going into H-4 status with an H-4 EAD can be very useful although sadly H-4 EAD processing these days is ridiculously slow.  So there is that.

To be clear, it is ideal for each spouse to have their own H-1B and if you can retain two separate H-1Bs, that is better (for various reasons) but if one spouse has to go to H-4/H-4 EAD for some limited amount of time, it will not turn that person into a frog.

Then again, the wait time for frogs might be faster than your current wait time for a green card....

Post Date: PERM labor certification is the main way an employer sponsors someone for a green card. 

Every PERM filing requires a 9141 prevailing wage determination. 

DOL has an epic unprecedented backlog on 9141s and no one in the Biden Administration seems to care. 

The slow 9141 processing is bad for everyone but particularly bad if -

- You are running out of H1B time (or L1 time). 

- You are running out of F1 OPT or STEM OPT - for those only eligible for OPT, it is a hopeless situation. 

- “Hopeless” includes nurses who are supposed to have a fast track for a green card.  What a mess. 

- Also tenure track faculty who are also supposed to have a special track for a green card.  Also a mess. 

I believe  is on the verge of suing DOL about the slow 9141 processing.  Hopefully more people sue. 

When will someone high up in the Biden Administration wake up to this problem?  

— They woke up to the EB immigrant visa quota and now EB 485s are pretty fast. 

— They have tried to address slow visa appointments in India (still have work to do). 

But nothing at DOL to address backlogs except more absurd slow processing month after month. 

Things are definitely getting worse.

Post Date: NEWS —- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced the elimination (ban) of non-compete agreements. 

See link here. 

For H-1B workers, this rule change could be significant to allow them to more easily participate in start-ups. 

If you are in H-1B status subject to a non-compete, that non-compete may no longer be enforceable. 

A few thoughts -

— An H-1B worker can be an owner or co-owner of a business in the US and that business can petition for H-1B status.  But a lot of important details should be considered. 

— This kind of H-1B can often be done well via a concurrent H-1B which helps to mitigate the prevailing wage requirements. 

— A concurrent H-1B works well for someone already in H-1B status but could also be structured as an exemption from the H-1B cap through a fellowship with . If you are not familiar with the structure of this kind of cap exemption, follow  for details. 

— Being part of a start-up, as a founder or co-founder, could facilitate a self-petition EB-2 NIW case as an entrepreneur. And for extremely successful ventures, perhaps EB-1A. 

— Given the ongoing “rolling recessions” in the US economy and the relatively tight labor market for many skilled professionals, going into a start-up as a founder or co-founder may be a great way to stay in the US.

Nepali F-1 pursuing Ph.D. in Earth Science/Environmental Science.

-- I-140 arrived at USCIS on June 28, 2024.

-- I-140 approved by USCIS on July 9, 2024, via premium process.

-- No RFE (Request for Evidence).

###

-- Self-petitioning client has F-1 travel visa valid until 2027.

-- Self-petitioning client is researching issues related to biodiversity and managing forest carbon.

-- Self-petitioning client does not have a job offer at a U.S. employer (yet).

###

The I-140 petition was set up for immigrant visa consular processing and the F-1 self-petitioning client should still be eligible for OPT and STEM OPT if the Visa Bulletin cut-off dates move slowly (which is likely).

An I-140 set up for consular processing can always be reconsidered for adjustment of status without an I-824.

-- Self-petitioning client has a Bachelor's degree in Engineering from India and Master's degree in Industrial Engineering from the US.

-- Self-petitioning client works at an engineering services firm (consulting firm) on-site at one of the most famous heavy construction vehicle manufacturers in the world.  

-- Self-petitioning client works on a variety of issues to improve the manufacturing process and deal with defect/warranty claims.

-- Now that EB-2 NIW I-140 is approved, the client's H-4 wife can apply for an H-4 EAD (work permit).

###

-- Yes, EB-2 India wait-times are terrible.  

-- And even the H-4 EAD processing times are terrible.

But she should get an EAD (work permit) in 6 months and that's better than the uncertainty of 2 years waiting for PERM (which his employer had not started).

###

Also, the EB-2 NIW I-140 approval was a self-petition, so the approval is tied to him personally.  He can go to any US employer and get an H-1B transfer and keep the self-petition I-140 approval alive (no new PERM needed).  This includes moving to become a W-2 employee at the client where he already works on-site.

Post Date: For F-1 students graduating now, many will be eligible for work authorization for 36 months --- OPT (12 months) + STEM OPT (24 months).  That may seem like a long time but in terms of U.S. immigration law processing, it is not!

###

Sadly, because of "per country" limits, F-1 students need to consider their options based on their country of birth.  Indian-born and mainland China-born students have less viable options in their 36 months of OPT/STEM OPT.

###

Basically the green card process is so slow for students born in India and China that (except for the rare candidate eligible for EB-1), students born in India or China need a temporary work visa while waiting for a green card.

I am not saying EB-1 is impossible for students but it is not as easy as some people say.  And I discourage it.  I have seen too many failures.

###

The most common temporary work visa is H-1B but because of the annual limit and lottery, private sector H-1Bs are hard to get.  Alternatives include lottery-exempt H-1B (at an academic institution), O-1s for very strong research profiles, or perhaps going abroad and returning to the US on L-1 visas after a year abroad at an affiliated subsidiary of a US company abroad.  If you do go abroad, try to stay long enough to be a manager for a year abroad and then come back as a manager in the US, then you will qualify for EB-1(C).

###

For students who were NOT born in India or mainland China, you have all the same temporary visa options but you can also see if your employer will sponsor you directly for a green card through the traditional employer green card process (PERM labor certification).  If you start right away, then 3 years (OPT + STEM OPT) MIGHT be enough time to get things done so you have green card based work authorization by the time your OPT/STEM OPT expires.  

For certain F-1 students NOT born in India or mainland China, with the right profile, EB-2 NIW may be an option to self-petition for a green card.

Post Date: 9141 prevailing wage determination - issued in less than 6 months and on a Sunday.  Signs of improvement?

[CORRECTION:  As was pointed out in the comments, the actual processing time for this 9141 was 194 days - so NOT less than 6 months.  Kind of a pathetic screw-up on my part, but the overall timing on the case and the fact that DOL is so slow remain true.  I guess the actual processing time just reinforces that things remain super slow and my hope that things were improving was misguided.  I was impressed to get the 9141 determination on a Sunday...]

###

◽ Employer sponsored green card processing generally requires the PERM labor certification process.

◽ All PERM labor certification applications require Form 9141 (prevailing wage determination).

◽ For the past couple years, 9141 determinations have generally taken 6 months or longer.

◽ Today (Feb 19, 2023 - a Sunday), we received a 9141 determination submitted on Aug 10, 2022, meaning the prevailing wage request took 172 days (just less than 6 months).  

###

Hopefully that is a sign of modest improvement by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL).

###

The employer will now have to proceed on the recruitment campaign (a process that can take 2-3 months), and then the 9089 PERM application can be filed if the employer is able to document a shortage of qualified and willing U.S. workers.  

So, getting the 9141 determination now means that the 9089 PERM application will potentially be filed in May 2023.

Right now, in Feb 2023, DOL is issuing 9089 PERM approvals for cases filed in the first half of May 2022.  

So, if we file this 9089 for this case in May 2023, then if processing times stay the same (a big if!), we will be looking at a PERM approval in Feb 2024.

Feb 2024 PERM approval for a job description (9141 prevailing wage request) submitted in Aug 2022.

Post Date: Your periodic reminder that PERM takes forever ---

-- May 2022:  Employer contacts Webber Law to start PERM for H-1B transfer candidate (Software Engineer).  Luckily he has an approved I-140 from a prior employer but he needs a new PERM and I-140 at his current employer (my client).

-- Sept 1, 2022:  PERM job description is finalized.  The employer does not handle a lot of PERM cases and so it took basically 3 months of back and forth to ensure we had the appropriate duties and requirements and the employer is re-calibrating its policies regarding work from home versus in the office, etc., and these things all must be sorted out PRIOR to finalizing a job description for PERM.

-- Sept 6, 2022:  9141 prevailing wage request submitted to DOL.

-- March 14, 2023:  Today - 189 days after the 9141 request was submitted, we received the 9141 prevailing wage determination.

###

-- April/May 2023:  We will need to do the required PERM recruitment campaign and if we are able to document a shortage of qualified US workers for the job offered, we will be able to file the PERM application probably in June 2023.

-- March 2024:  Assuming processing times for 9089 PERM applications remain the same, if we file this case in June 2023, then we will end up with a PERM approval in March 2024.

###

I have said this before, but it can easily be close to 24 months from starting a PERM to getting a PERM approval, and of course people often need the PERM approval and I-140 approval to really benefit them.

Post Date: How do earthquakes in Iceland relate to US immigration law?

•••

Well, probably not at all but they remind me of something bad that happened to a client of mine many years ago - so take note. 

Many years ago a client of mine on an H-1B visa traveled to Europe and had a plan to cut it super close when returning to the US. I think she planned to return with 2 days left on her visa.  It was a long trip, like 2 months. 

It is permissible to return so close to the expiration of your visa but it is not a good idea. 

The H-1B extension could have been prepared before she left and filed but it was prepared to be filed right when she returned. 

But that year there was this freak thing that there were earthquakes and volcanos in Iceland that created weather problems that canceled flights in Europe for like 2-3 days and she couldn’t get back in time. 

So she was stuck in Europe but she was actually from Asia so she had to go to Asia and wait for the extension to be approved, then get a new visa and return to the US. Her job was not one where work from home was an option (she worked in a manufacturing facility) and this was well before WFH was trendy. 

•••

Anyway, the point is just because you can return with only 2 days left on your visa, it might not be a good idea. Weather or other unexpected delays could abruptly change your plans. 

And there is probably a broader lesson for issues in immigration law - just because you can do something; it might not be a good idea and there may be unforeseen issues. 

Prior to that incident years ago, I would not have connected Icelandic volcanos to weather related flight delays in Europe.

You probably wouldn't say - "Ok, that's good.  That is what I was looking for in a restaurant.  I can eat here."

###

This bizarre thing that has happened in the last few years where people think there are refunds for legal services.  What the heck?

Who started this stupid trend?  And how has it infected the minds of so many people?

If your lawyer is offering you a refund for a denied case, why are they doing that?  Because they get a lot of denied cases?

If your lawyer has an elaborate plan for a RFE and denial, why are they doing that?  

Because a lot of their cases get RFEs and get denied?

Shouldn't they just get your case approved?

###

There is just so much garbage out there.  And bad thinking.  I feel like the bigger my network gets, the more garbage it collects.  And bad thinking.  Just people who cannot think clearly.

In my view, good lawyers, like good doctors, don't offer refunds.  They are professionals and you are paying for their time and expertise.  They don't operate in the world of gimmicks (notwithstanding the use of memes!).

###

If you are a prospective client, you should be looking for a lawyer who knows what he (or she) is doing and will do it right the first time.

Foreign nationals who think that refunds are some kind of end-all are just not thinking straight.  If you file a bad case and wait months and get it denied, re-filing is not really a great thing to do.  You have lost time and the fact that your first case was denied doesn't mean your second case will be approved.  

It is obviously MUCH better to do it right the first time, or not do it at all.

If you want to hire a 'garbage-in, garbage-out' law firm, fine.  

But try not to bother those of us who are actually trying to be good.

Post Date: Each year the US government is permitted to approve a limited number of H-1B visas (although some employers are EXEMPT from the limit).

The H-1B limit is known as the H-1B cap.

Because there is so much demand and limited supply, USCIS conducts a lottery (the H-1B cap lottery) to determine which H-1B petitions go forward for processing.

The last few years (2020, 2021, 2022) - the lottery was done through an electronic pre-registration process.  The pre-registration process and lottery is conducted in March.  Most employers (and lawyers) 'harvest' cases for the lottery in January to submit them into the pre-registration process in March.

In 2020 and 2021, there were actually multiple lotteries.  There were 2 lotteries in 2020 and 3 lotteries in 2021.  This year, there was only 1 lottery.  To be clear, the multiple lotteries are only for those who entered in March.

One thing that is odd is that this year USCIS announced they had 'used' all the H-1B visas, that is, the cap had been reached; but objectively there are many pending cases.  (We actually still have a pending case, for certain complex reasons).

Since there are pending cases, how does this work?  

-- Does USCIS pre-determine how many pending cases are approved or denied to reach its cap?  That doesn't seem lawful.

-- If USCIS has not already pre-designated the number of approvals and denials among pending cases, then won't there naturally be more approvals (exceeding the cap) or not enough approvals?

Maybe the number of cases in question is very limited but for those people who were hoping to get an H-1B this year against the cap, it would be nice to know that the system is being rigorously implemented and not a single H-1B visa number is going unused.

We have now handled multiple cases for foreign nationals working in various roles within the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry, often for people who are not in traditional R&D roles.

The law firms who represent many of those companies (particularly the very large ones) generally push everyone into PERM.

PERM is definitely all right if you can get it; but for those people who want more flexibility and control of their immigration situation, EB-2 NIW can provide some benefit even though the EB-2 wait times are long.

Post Date: In journalism, there is a concept of “burying the lede.”

It is something you do NOT want to do. 

This comes up in immigration law where there is something strong in a case but somehow it is buried in a lot of other evidence. 

I see more and more people trying to do their own immigration case (which is fine by me) - and they might have some good points but the good evidence is buried in a sea of noise. 

In my view people writing 50 page letters are doing it wrong. 

Or maybe they have good evidence and they think if they get 8 people saying precisely the same thing it is persuasive when in reality it might end up being not persuasive. 

I am not claiming some divine monopoly on how to frame EB immigration cases but the most common thing I see is “overcooking”. 

I have this image of an overworked and slightly (or more than slightly) jaded officer reviewing case filings quickly and eyes glossing over in a sea of words.

Post Date: Some terminology to know in U.S. immigration law -

-- Your "status" determines how long you can be in the US, and it is not the same as your "visa" which is the thing stamped into your passport by a US consulate.  Your "visa" might be expired but your "status" might be valid.  Your "status" is generally based on your I-94 admission record.

-- You generally need a valid "visa" to travel into the US to present yourself to a border officer (with various exceptions including for those lovable Canucks, at least most of them).

-- A "petition" is something that is filed on your behalf, so an employer might file an H-1B petition, or a spouse might file an I-130 petition, and an I-140 may be in some circumstances filed as a SELF-petition.  If it is a self-petition, then you are both the petitioner and beneficiary.  

-- For an H-1B petition, it is technically the employer's PETITION and you are the BENEFICIARY.

-- An application is a filing made by a specific person for himself/herself:  So an I-539 application is filed by H. Potter to extend his status or possibly change his status to F-1 to attend West Coast Hogwarts.  But an exception to the term "application" exists in the US Department of Labor (DOL) where a PERM labor certification APPLICATION is an application (not a petition), but it is filed by an employer.

-- So, if DOL were on the same page as USCIS, they would call it a PERM labor certification petition.  (But DOL is never on the same page as USCIS...)

-- Oh, and as far as DOL goes, a Labor Condition Application ("LCA") is something relevant to an H-1B petition but a PERM labor certification application is relevant for a green card (permanent residence).  You will confuse people if you use the abbreviation LCA if you mean PERM.  

-- The term "change of status" means going from one temporary visa status to another, whereas the term "adjustment of status" means going from a temporary visa status to permanent resident status.

-- "Nonimmigrants" are people coming to the US temporarily and "immigrants" are people coming to the US indefinitely with a green card.

-- "Green card holder" is basically interchangeable with "legal permanent resident".  If someone uses the term "resident alien" - you should have your radar up that they are using a term from tax law and there are many "nonimmigrants" who are "resident aliens" for tax purposes.

-- It is "H-1B" ---- not "H1-B".

 -- "DOS" is the abbreviation for "Department of State."  I believe it is also the main operating system used by all government agencies in processing your case.

Post Date: The US immigration system is ridiculous- too many good people are not selected in the H-1B cap and the Visa Bulletin barely moves. 

Canada is cold and expensive. 

If you can do your job remotely from home, there seem to be all kinds of places where you could be. 

Check out the list in the first comment below!

What have you heard?  Anyone using one of these digital nomad visas?

I can imagine some US immigration lawyers considering some of these options…

Post Date: 2 Pro Tips for the Foreign Nationals out there -

1 - YOUR NAME.

When communicating with people by email, particularly an immigration lawyer who is slightly obsessed with precision and details, you should use your legal name in communications and your email name (the name listed next to your email address) should really be your legal name, not GMAIL.  

Now I realize that if your name is Tikki Tikki Tembo-no Sa Rembo, it might be too long to be efficient but at least give that some thought like "Tikki T.T.S. Rembo." - not "Shirley."

2 - YOUR RESUME.

You really need to list your actual employers on your resume.  I realize that many foreign nationals work at NO NAME CONSULTING, on-site at FAMOUS COMPANY, INC.  But you are not doing anyone any favors where you create a resume (or linkedin profile) that implies fairly explicitly that you work directly at FAMOUS COMPANY, INC.

I realize my efforts on these issues are forever issues.  But I will tilt at these windmills until I am buried under the dirt.

Post Date: Here is a controversial take:  If Trump is elected this fall, "his people" will eliminate the very strict requirements currently requiring the Covid Vaccine for those seeking green cards.

I am vaccinated (although I don't have all the boosters, and I don't have strong feelings about vaccines), but I was reminded of USCIS policies on the Covid vaccine today as one of our clients just got her green card and she was VERY conflicted about doing the Covid-19 vaccine.

And I do know several people who feel strongly about the Covid-19 vaccine (not wanting to do it).

In my view, the Covid vaccine is just not something for which USCIS should be so strict, that is, the waivers should be relatively liberal.

It might be one of the very few things where Trump 2.0 will be 'more liberal' -- and when I mean 'liberal' - I mean flexible for the immigrant.

Post Date: It should be obvious but perhaps it is not --> Telling the USCIS that you are doing something "really important" -- but "it is secret" - is not going to work.

Often the USCIS adjudicator will not believe you even if you provide details but "believe me, this is big; it is just secret" is just not going to work.

And let's be honest, it should NOT work.

Details matter.  Credibility matters.

Post Date: I think it can be easy, particularly if you live in a big city on the East or West Coast, to forget how important the agricultural sector is and traditionally how much innovation has occurred and continues to occur within that sector. 

Here in Minnesota and in other parts of the Midwest there are lots of highly skilled scientists and technicians addressing all kinds of challenges and coming up with creative solutions. 

People often think, rightfully, of the immigrants who work in manual labor jobs in the ag sector but a lot of the innovation in ag comes from skilled foreign nationals.

I have been fortunate to work with a number of scientists and vets and techs in the ag sector utilizing the whole alphabet of nonimmigrant visas. 

•••

I am not involved in this company or its new FDA-approved supplement but seeing this was just a reminder about all the various ways innovation continues with the ways we feed ourselves, and the world. 

If you are in F-1 status and worry you are pursuing a field of study that may be over saturated- consider whether your skills might be applied to ag or food production.
