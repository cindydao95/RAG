Post Date: I created Waypoint Immigration USA to serve the needs of üí• individual employees üí• in the employment-based immigration process. From what I can see, there just aren't a lot of tailored legal services on the market where individuals can go to get advice. All the firms I know of represent either employers only or employers and employees at the same time. Conflicts abound, and deference to companies happens a lot, even when both parties should be on equal footing with the attorney. When starting my firm, I got a lot of consultations scheduled and requests to handle individual cases. I love providing these services, but I think that my most important service is the Case Review service. This is where employees can ask for a full review of their case before the employer files it, catch errors, get an opinion about how strong it is, and talk about other things that matter to them personally. I just reviewed an ETA 9089 (PERM case) right before it was filed. In this consultation, I did a comprehensive review of pdfs of the case materials and then had a half hour video call with my client. During the call we talked about: üö© Errors on the Employment Verification Letter than were likely to cause problems 8 months from now üïô Timelines for filing the ETA 9089 and how that worked with the limited remaining H-1B time ‚úÖ Why the employers attorney likely used certain language as a strategy on the PERM and why it was good ‚ùå How certain terms of a reimbursement contract were unenforceable or misleading, clarifying exactly what the consequences of breaking the contract would be if the employee wants to move jobs in the next 2 years üåéTravel and career plans I really believe employees need this kind of service. It's hard to put full faith in a big corporation and the big law firms that provide the case preparation services given the sheer volume they are dealing with. I used to be an attorney in this setting, and while I was good at my job, there were days when I would review 100 cases. I couldn't tell you the names of most of the individual employees I reviewed matters for on any given day. I saw mistakes a lot, and admittedly I even made a few myself. Employees can obtain personalized advice that helps avoid problems down the road. There may not be a lot of service options yet, but I am excited to see more attorneys do what I am doing in the future, making immigration better for individuals. #immigrationlawyer #immigrationattorney #employees #employeeexperience #employeerights #employeeadvocacy #workersrights #detailsmatter #perm #h1b #f1visa #stemopt

Post Date: She wanted to refile and had built up her profile since her first EB-1A denial.

She wasn‚Äôt exactly C-suite and was going for EB-1A in a highly competitive field, data analytics.

And as expected, we got hit with a nasty, nit-picky RFE.

In our response, we decided to not provide additional evidence because there was more than enough in our submission to show that my client met the EB-1 criteria and was extraordinary in her field.

We‚Äôre talking someone who has had years of leadership experience in the field of data analytics actively leading and making technical contributions to projects for many well-known companies.

Instead, we responded with a letter that primarily contained a legal argument.

My client‚Äôs application was approved, and just weeks before Christmas.

Excited to see where she takes her career.

Post Date: My client never made any misrepresentations.

USCIS simply assumed that she did even though she never said anything about a particular period of her work history where she worked for an employer that was later found to be engaged in employment fraud (one of those shady companies that asks immigrants to pay them in exchange for employment and sponsorship).

At the time of employment, my client saw the company as perfectly legitimate. She was even given actual work to do by the employer.

The big law firm that she had worked with before Waypoint even told her to check the box stating that yes, she had made misrepresentations (even though she hadn‚Äôt).

We‚Äôre now in the process of:

‚Ä¢ Writing out an explanation of what had happened to the consulate to get them to reconsider their findings.
‚Ä¢ Filing a TRIP complaint alleging that USCIS had mistakenly found my client guilty of misrepresentation.

A general rule to follow - if USCIS accuses you of misrepresentation and you know you haven‚Äôt engaged in any sort of misrepresentation, don‚Äôt just concede to their findings. Exhaust your options first. Always find some way to appeal and fight back, or risk having a mark on your record that might come back years down the line to hurt you, especially for future immigration benefits.

And if your lawyer doesn‚Äôt agree and refuses to help you fight, find a new lawyer.

Post Date: A lot of the people from abroad who decide to apply for EB-2 NIW usually have plans to start their own venture in the U.S.

But that‚Äôs not the only route to securing EB-2 NIW - you don‚Äôt have to start your own business nor is that necessarily favored by USCIS.

Yes, it‚Äôs absolutely possible to apply for EB-2 NIW with the intention of finding a job in the U.S. in a field that you‚Äôre currently in or in one that‚Äôs similar to the one in which you‚Äôre currently working.

You will need strong reference letters and it can be a completely different kind of case to say the applicant who wants to move to the U.S. to start their own business.

From my experience, industry NIWs from abroad come down to proposed endeavor and also the strength of your existing ties to the U.S., which is something you will have to show in your petition.

Existing ties, not potential ties, as in you already have to have these relationships with U.S. companies or individuals who are related to your proposed endeavor and are willing to vouch for you. It‚Äôs even better if they can explain to USCIS that immediate opportunities exist, or propose some kind of consulting arrangement or potential future partnership.

Post Date: Spoke to a few consultation clients in the last few weeks about their EB-1A Notices of Intent to Deny.

For a lot of cases that encounter NOIDs, I tend to suggest withdrawing and refiling after further case development.

The reality is that sometimes, there is not much you can do.

If the NOID is being issued because the initial presentation and construction of the case was not well done (like not defining the field of expertise and just focusing on the criteria on their own, out of context), trying to introduce a solid framework for the case at this late stage is probably not going to convince an officer. And retaining an experienced attorney who could do so is unlikely, because almost no one has capacity to take on and file a case within the short 30 day deadline of these NOIDs.

If the NOID is being issued by a bad officer who, regardless of how you respond, will misapply the law and deny your case, then it‚Äôs pretty hopeless. A denial from a bad officer does not mean your case was weak. It simply means you drew a bad officer.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I have successfully overcome NOIDs before and can do so if the initial case was strong and the officer isn‚Äôt too biased.

But in the vast majority of these cases, withdrawing and refiling with experienced attorney representation is the move here.

Post Date: If you‚Äôre applying for EB-2 NIW from abroad, you might want to show existing ties to the U.S.

Perhaps there‚Äôs a company you want to work for that‚Äôs related to the field in which you‚Äôre currently working, and that company has expressed an interest in hiring you.

Perhaps there‚Äôs some research that you‚Äôd like to do that‚Äôs popular in the U.S. and an organization has expressed an interest in having you contribute to that research.

To prove these ties, you also want to have specific individuals attest to your ability to carry out your proposed endeavor.

These could be people you‚Äôll be working with should your application be approved as well as industry experts who based on their experience can state that you do have a profile and qualifications to carry out your proposed endeavor.

Post Date: There are three types of NIW profile:

1. You do not have much of an NIW profile and your case is generally weak. For you, I‚Äôd suggest profile-building first. I tend not to file these cases as they will usually result in a denial.

2. Your profile is somewhat strong. Not 90% chances of approval strong, but above 50%. This is where the decision of whether to file is up to you (you can either file immediately or profile-build).

3. Your profile is incredibly strong and your chances of approval are in the 90s. You should file immediately as profile-building will only marginally increase your chances of approval (they still can, but only by very little).

Try to know which category you fall into before taking action.

Last thing you want to do is to work with a lawyer to file a weak case or not file even though you already have a strong case that will only marginally benefit from more profile-building.

Post Date: Filed a couple of NIWs last week.

One for a client who works in banking and specializes in digital analytics.

His proposed endeavor? Improving the integrity and security of the U.S. financial system.

That being said, if you‚Äôre in a non-STEM field like anything finance related, getting an NIW approval might be more difficult as USCIS tends to favor STEM graduates in fields that have directly been highlighted as being national priorities.

You can still build a strong case - you just need to work on your proposed endeavor statement.

Post Date: There were a lot of layoffs these last few weeks (Apple, Tesla, Nike, to name a few).

Some of the big companies that are doing these layoffs (like Google) have also announced that they‚Äôll be laying off more staff later on in the year, and to expect more layoffs.

Amazon apparently said they were pausing until the end of 2024, so layoffs could continue through September or even later.

For those who are on H-1B who are laid off, 60 days is simply not enough time to find a new job.

USCIS seems to get that and seems to be processing B-2 changes of status extremely quickly (which gives those who are looking for a job an extra 6 months).

A recent B-2 I filed was approved in 3 weeks.

For those of you who have been affected by layoffs, definitely consider a B-2 change of status as early as possible, ideally right around the 45 day mark of your H-1B grace period.

Post Date: NIW can be much faster than PERM because of the PERM backlog. 

If your company is experiencing layoffs and has halted its PERM program, then NIW is definitely the faster route.

NIW does require a lot more additional work though, especially if you don‚Äôt already have a strong profile, and is not as straightforward as PERM.

Post Date: A lot of immigration consultants focus on an applicant‚Äôs profile of past accomplishments.

That‚Äôs not the full picture when it comes to EB-2 NIW.

It‚Äôs ‚Äúproposed endeavor‚Äù that matters most, not necessarily the profile (this is something I emphasize in my course - NIW Ready - and is why in the course we continually help you revise your proposed endeavor statement as you build up your profile).

To focus on profile alone is an oversimplification of what USCIS really looks at for NIW.

Showing that you have the background to do AI research, after all, is not as convincing an argument for NIW as showing a detailed plan for what you intend to do that is in the national interest.

To strengthen your argument, your plan could mention:

- A list of companies or types of companies you plan to work for.
- Specific projects or types of projects you plan to take on.
- A university you plan to partner with.
- A sub-field of AI where you have research papers - insights from which you intend to use for industry work, etc.
- Organizations you plan to participate in.
- References from top individuals in your field of expertise and their support for what you plan to do and how it will benefit the field as a whole.

Remember - you‚Äôre arguing for a waiver of PERM because it‚Äôs in the national interest so show that what you will be doing with that waiver benefits national interests.

It‚Äôs one thing to imply that you have the potential to benefit national interests and another to show a strong plan for how you intend to pursue an endeavor that aligns with national interests.

It‚Äôs all in the ‚Äúhow,‚Äù not just potential.

Post Date: Layoffs affect PERM.

If you were counting on your ETA 9089 coming through and are on your fifth year of H-1B, and your employer suddenly announces layoffs (and lays you off), you do not have enough time to file a new PERM with a new employer.

If you are in this situation, definitely consider EB-2 NIW, even if you have a long shot at getting an approval.

You might also want to consider a couple months to build your profile before filing.

Getting an approval also helps with securing your next job as you can then assure your employer that you can stay long term and not have to leave the U.S.

Post Date: NIW is slept on.

Here are 3 amazing benefits you get with NIW:

1. Freedom from your employer.

I've had clients have to give up dream job offers because they were stuck in a PERM process.

I've had clients delay joining their dream FAANG employer because they were stuck in a PERM process.

If career flexibility is a top priority for you, look into NIW as soon as you can because with it, you can switch employers freely (while on H-1B).

2. A faster path to a green card.

If you're ROW (rest of world) and not an Indian or Chinese national, it might be a 1-3 year wait (not 4-10+, or yikes, 90+ years).

Even for Chinese nationals, EB-2 is still a valid way to a faster green card (the backlog is 4-5 years).

3. A priority date.

PERM can be a painful way right now to get a priority date.

With NIW, regardless of where you're from, you can get a priority date.
This absolutely helps if you're ROW.

This definitely helps if you're a Chinese national.

Helps too if you're an Indian national, especially if we see a sudden advancement in priority dates in the future (as we saw in 2020). This might be a pipe dream in the near term, but looking 5+ years out, this is a definitely possibility as the laws change and world circumstances evolve.

Bonus benefit: building your NIW profile also helps your career in the long run.

NIW applicants, which one of these benefits do you care most about?

Post Date: Media attention ‚Äì love it or hate it, expertise that is publicly discussed in the media sets people above their peers. It is a strong indicator of expertise to people outside of your field of work and can be powerful. 

I also have a love/hate relationship with this criterion in the EB-1A context. But it is one of those criteria that is easiest to build on your own, so it is well worth considering if you are planning to apply for EB-1A in the future.

Post Date: Had this question come up a few times in consultations over the last couple of weeks. 

Also had a few lawyers talk to me about this issue that their clients were having (after changing jobs while on H-1B) with their new employer insisting that they had to go through PERM to get an H-1B extension past the 6-year maximum even though they already had an NIW approval.

That‚Äôs pretty crazy. And flat out wrong. 

The short answer is yes, you can use an NIW approval the same way you‚Äôd use any PERM-based I-140 approval from a previous employer.

The law draws no distinctions between the two - you can use an NIW approval to extend your H-1B past the 6-year maximum, you can use it for H-4 EADs, and you can use it to retain your priority date.

Very odd that company lawyers are telling employees that their NIW approval is not valid when it is, and this just goes to show that sometimes even your company lawyers may not have the most accurate information (or simply aren‚Äôt transparent).

One reason for this might be that the attorneys simply haven‚Äôt seen NIWs in the past and don‚Äôt know what to do with them. This is the case for even highly experienced lawyers and firms, since NIWs in tech are a relatively new trend. 

Another reason for this is that companies seem to find more immigration ‚Äúissues‚Äù if they want to lay someone off or get them to quit. Often this kind of advice doesn‚Äôt come from the lawyer, but it comes from a company rep who is using the cover of counsel to imply things that just aren‚Äôt true, and the company lawyer is afraid (or at least, unmotivated) to ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù them. 

So just be aware that there are companies out there that don‚Äôt think your NIW approval is legitimate, and if you do encounter a company lawyer who insists that you still need PERM, definitely speak to an experienced immigration lawyer who does not work for your company for a second opinion.

Post Date: International students, carefully vet the recruiters who reach out to you on social media.
 
I just talked with a client who graduated last year. Apparently multiple (not one, not two, but several) companies tried to recruit her on social media for OPT employment. Including on LinkedIn! But these companies aren‚Äôt offering the jobs they claim they‚Äôre offering. Instead, they offer "training" and a platform to circulate resumes out to other companies to get meaningful project work. No salary. No official job duties. 
 
These companies can never fulfill the requirements for OPT. And especially not STEM OPT.
 
But they make it sound like they are giving you a real job, with a real offer letter. These companies are devious and prey on students‚Äô willingness to get training and practical experience. 
 
They say ‚Äúyou put in the work and then you will see results‚Äù. 
 
It‚Äôs an idea that makes sense when you‚Äôre a recent grad with no experience working in the real world. But it will get you in trouble. 
 
My client got a job offer from one of these companies. Luckily, she only stayed 2 months. This time is well within the 90 days‚Äô max unemployment period, so we can explain to USCIS that she still maintained status even if that time can't count as work. She‚Äôll be fine. 
 
But the company? Apparently they are still in business a year later. And now they want to charge $$$ for any prior ‚Äúemployee‚Äù that wants a letter from them describing the employment arrangement. Letters that USCIS asks for. Letters that will get the OPT worker in BIG trouble.

All the focus in the immigrant community right now seems to be on the employers that the FBI has already caught, and the enforcement against individual F-1 visa holders that is occurring years later. But this kind of fraud is still happening in earlier stages right now. Expect to see more enforcement actions against more and more companies in the future.

Post Date: I get this question a lot - since certain fields are heavily favored right now by USCIS, should I try to find work in my field that overlaps with one of these hot fields? (like AI)

Yes and no.

Yes, in that if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôve always wanted to and it makes sense in the context of your profile, definitely go for it. I‚Äôve definitely seen clients who work in subfields of AI that do make sense in the context of their profile.

No, in that if you‚Äôre just going to tack on one of these hot fields onto your profile, thinking that USCIS won‚Äôt notice that it doesn‚Äôt really match, chances are you‚Äôll draw more attention from them for something that appears out of place in the context of your profile and career.

This decision also comes down to how soon you aim to apply for EB-2 NIW. If you intend to apply in 1-2 years, perhaps you can try to find work in one of the more favored national interest fields like AI (but do keep in mind that with the upcoming election, national priorities may change).

If you intend to file in the next few months, best to not suddenly change to a different, more favored field thinking that doing so will give your application a significant boost.

You‚Äôll probably just be inviting more questions from USCIS.

Make your petition work for your career trajectory. Not the other way around - that‚Äôs backwards.

Post Date: If you‚Äôve been laid off, remember that your former company is obligated to reimburse you for transportation costs associated with your return to your home country.

Even if you‚Äôve changed to B-2 and spent the last 6 months job-searching, I would argue that you are still eligible for reimbursement.

A lot of corporate attorneys might disagree and try to put parameters and limitations on this saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù (often retroactively, saying there is a policy when there actually isn‚Äôt and has never been - I think a ton of corporates forgot about this expense when putting together budgets for their mass layoffs), but the reimbursement is a legal obligation.

If you have a question about this, feel free to leave it in the comments.

Post Date: We got a junior professor‚Äôs NIW approved the other day.

This is a particularly noteworthy case because it seems to reflect a different standard to the one laid out in Dhanasar - ‚Äúthe‚Äù cornerstone NIW case.

In the matter of Dhanasar, research was cited as particularly important in considering an applicant‚Äôs eligibility for NIW but not teaching, which while cited as carrying substantial merit, USCIS basically said should not be considered as rising to the level of national importance on its own.

In the case we filed for our junior professor client, we focused a lot on her teaching experiences (mostly because she didn‚Äôt have that much research under her belt and she was a really good and really motivated teacher).

We got an approval relatively quickly with no RFE.

Perhaps USCIS has changed the standard a bit since Dhanasar, which is not surprising considering the lack of definition around NIW (all kinds of endeavors can qualify depending on how you present your case) and the fact that NIW is highly reliant on agency discretion. Don‚Äôt we all know that teachers are super important to the U.S. national interest now?

Perhaps the law now favors junior professors with teaching experience and doesn‚Äôt care as much if they have little to no research experience.

Goes to show also that sometimes, pushing the boundaries of traditional thought behind case filings can lead to all kinds of new, previously considered ‚Äúweak‚Äù cases that now might actually have a shot.

With NIW approval rates this high (they‚Äôre 90%+ in STEM right now, but maybe everyone‚Äôs submitting super strong cases?), we should be pushing boundaries.

Post Date: B-2 makes sense for someone on H-1B who just got laid off.

But I caution anyone on F-1 or J-1 to switch to B-2.

Remember that you‚Äôre not supposed to show nonimmigrant intent while on F-1 or J-1 and a switch to B-2 may to USCIS appear to be immigrant intent.

Every situation is different so if you are currently on F-1 or J-1 and want to stay longer in the U.S. instead of leaving, you might want to speak to an immigration lawyer who has experience with these matters. Sometimes this is justifiable. Other times it opens up long term risks.

Post Date: In recent years, I‚Äôve seen a lot more independent consultants and unlicensed consulting firms help NIW applicants with their petitions. 

Telling them to put things down that USCIS has liked in the past but have nothing to do with the applicant‚Äôs profile.

For those of you who are looking for shortcuts to NIW, even if you get an approval, when you apply for your green card or even later when you apply for citizenship, you could be scrutinized.

You will be questioned on why, for example, you mentioned in your NIW application a proposed endeavor that you never intended to pursue.

Like why you said you will start a business when you have no prior entrepreneurship experience, and then never actually ended up starting one once you were in the U.S.

Or why you said you were getting a fancy AI job when you were never really that qualified (just got some relevant certifications to use in the NIW) and then always worked a normal software engineering job instead.

Applicants, do not take shortcuts thinking that USCIS is not going to hold you accountable.

Post Date: NIWs and AI?

He was an AI software engineering leader at a household name and had risen through the ranks.

After five and a half years on an H-1B, it was time to apply for a green card, which his employer gladly initiated. 

Except for one major issue - a mistake on his PERM had been found late in the green card process, which resulted in a denial of my client‚Äôs PERM.

My client had therefore no options available to remain in the U.S.,

Except for NIW.

Yes, the National Interest Waiver for which the bar to meet is usually incredibly high.

My client also did not have a standard NIW profile. No major publications, just a few speaking gigs here and there at industry conferences. 

But we got him over the finish line. Once we started working together, I knew the biggest hurdle was explaining to USCIS how my client‚Äôs AI work was of national importance. With a team of legal writers (a core part of the Waypoint Immigration USA team and key to a lot of our case approvals), we were able to sufficiently convince USCIS that my client met the criteria for qualifying for an NIW.

My client‚Äôs NIW was approved relatively quickly and he can now extend his H-1B indefinitely. He‚Äôs also no longer tied down by one employer.

So yes, AI and NIWs do go hand in hand.

Post Date: There comes a time when profile-building is no longer something to keep doing.

I get the need to maximize chances of approval by doing everything possible to strengthen your profile, but sometimes a 65-70% chance is something you just have to take.

Even if it‚Äôs possible to get to 90%.

Why?

Because getting to 90% for your specific profile might take a few extra years, not months.

This applies more so to EB-1A than to EB-2 NIW (where you can increase your chances of approval significantly with 2-3 months of focused profile-building).

Some attorneys might disagree with this perspective and encourage clients to do every little thing to maximize their chances of approval, but I like to let clients make a choice based on their situation (my role is more to lay out potential scenarios and possibilities, and not to make a decision for you).

Some clients are fine with their current chances and so they decide to file.

It‚Äôs about opening up possibilities, even if that means potentially getting more denials.

Writing and publishing takes time, so it is not something that is a quick addition to a potential EB-1A petition. However, it is well worth the effort given some lead time of a year or two. Publications also look impressive in fields of work where you would not normally be expected to publish.

Post Date: Substantial startup funding (whether Angel or Venture Capital) is a great way to show you meet a big part of the O-1 criteria.

Specifically recognition of expertise and proof of acclaim (at least that‚Äôs how USCIS sees things as of right now).

That being said, be careful with how you present your role at your startup before you have official work authorization, as certain activities may be considered unauthorized work.

Having a cofounder who has a green card or is a citizen can help to demonstrate that you were engaging in legitimate startup business activities and not actual work. You can push a lot of tasks off to a cofounder if you are worried those tasks might get you in trouble.

You‚Äôll still be able to take care of incorporating the business and seeking funding, but if you‚Äôre employed full time by another company or are still on F-1 status, just be careful as performing certain tasks may jeopardize your current or future H-1B status.

It‚Äôs not a well defined area of law. The U.S. is fond of its ‚Äúbalancing tests‚Äù instead of bright-line rules. Unfortunately, overzealous CBP officers sometimes refuse to acknowledge gray areas of law on the other hand and are preparing to assume the worst about you even if you are doing everything in a legitimate way. Hire an attorney to help you understand the risks involved and to help you make a plan.

Post Date: The stronger your EB-1A profile, the less likely you are to get denied because of USCIS discretion.

This is because your case will speak to a wider range of officers, all of whom have their own opinions about what the EB-1A standard is.

Of course, there‚Äôs always the chance you get a bad officer who denies your case without even reviewing materials submitted. Some of them just don‚Äôt seem to approve any case. The firms that file lots of EB-1s have a list of these officers.

But if you‚Äôre trying to avoid a denial from a strict officer and your case is considered borderline, it might make sense to spend more time (for some a few months and others a few years) on profile-building before applying.

Especially if you‚Äôre in no rush to apply.

Post Date: I spoke to a FAANG employee the other day.

He was complaining about how his entire company‚Äôs PERM program has now been on hold for a year and a half.

If your company is currently experiencing layoffs and planning more layoffs, expect most of your company‚Äôs PERM program to be on hold even longer.

Which means for immigrants who work at one of the FAANGs, PERM may no longer be a possibility in the near future.

But there are other ways to secure that priority date outside of PERM, especially for a lot of FAANG employees.

EB-1A might be an option for more senior employees but if you‚Äôre more on the junior end or mid-level, consider NIW especially if you‚Äôre working on something AI-related, or high tech and super important to the U.S.

Right now, there are variables in your favor if you‚Äôre in AI or these other high tech sectors that can help you get on the path to a green card without the help of an employer.

Start exploring your options now while you can, as all of this could change with the upcoming election.

Post Date: Generally speaking, as early on in your immigration journey as possible.

A few years ago, PERM used to be the best way to secure a priority date. It was fastest and easiest. 

Things are completely different now - with mass layoffs and PERM backlogs, a lot of people are either trapped in a PERM process with no movement in sight or nowhere near filing a PERM. 

It‚Äôs why nowadays, I recommend recent graduates and even current students to start looking into backup options like EB-2 NIW for their green card and then other nonimmigrant visa options like O-1 for their temporary status after OPT.

Generally speaking, anyone (especially STEM graduates) who does not have a priority date should at least be aware of EB-2 NIW and its benefits (if not actively pursuing it as a way to get a priority date without needing an employer).

Post Date: It‚Äôs not the people who are bad,

But the system that‚Äôs bad.

A system that‚Äôs incentivized to churn out cookie-cutter cases for financial gain.

I get it - if you‚Äôre a large or mid-sized law firm, you probably get thousands of cases that have to be submitted on time. Financially you also gain a lot out of submitting all these cases.

So you‚Äôre incentivized to take on and submit as many cases as possible.

But remember that these are people‚Äôs futures at stake. No case should be seen as ‚Äúcookie-cutter‚Äù and forced into a mold so a law firm can make a quick buck.

That‚Äôs what I personally believe and the reason I started Waypoint - I was simply fed up with the depersonalized way some firms handle immigration cases at scale. 

Yes, scale is important, but not when you‚Äôre rushing things and following a formulaic approach that means some applicants who should‚Äôve gotten a fair shot at a future in this country are hurt.

Post Date: A company-sponsored EB-2 NIW is not the same as a self-sponsored EB-2 NIW.

Here are some differences:

- For an employer-sponsored EB-2 NIW, your current employer will have a lot more say over what is put down as your proposed endeavor, which can affect your chances of getting approved.
- If they control your proposed endeavor, even if you get approved, for the I-140 to be valid you‚Äôll have to still be working with your current employer at the time you file an adjustment application.
- Your employer will get to see everything you put down in your application if you go down the employer-sponsored route. Depending on what you want to disclose to your employer, you may be limited in what you put down in your petition. Some employers disapprove of ‚Äúextracurricular activities‚Äù (which is insane to me, but it can get quite political). 

Generally speaking, if you can afford to file on your own without your employer, file on your own.

It will give you maximum flexibility and control.

Post Date: Something to keep in mind if you got picked in the March H-1B lottery but have been laid off (or will be this summer):

Even if you‚Äôre about to get laid off, it‚Äôs still possible to have your current company file your H-1B petition if you got selected for H-1B.

If you still have a few weeks left at your current company, definitely try to have them file your H-1B petition.

The H-1B is for a future job, starting in October. Some companies are willing to file the petition and consider you for rehiring in October depending on how they are doing financially and where they are at with further layoffs. Some companies are not even willing to consider this at all. Make sure you know where your company stands and don‚Äôt just take the word of the first person you talk to. Try to get this request up the chain so more people are considering it.

Something to also be aware of is that for you to get H-1B status, you need to be working for the employer that sponsored you in October of that year and collect a paycheck for that work. This is the only way to have certainty that you have ‚Äúactivated‚Äù the H-1B.

If you got laid off and that‚Äôs no longer possible, it‚Äôs best to have your next employer file an amendment or ‚ÄúChange of Employer‚Äù petition to see if you can keep your H-1B lottery slot. USCIS doesn‚Äôt seem to have a formal policy on whether or not they will grant this type of petition on ‚Äúunactivated‚Äù H-1Bs (so those H-1B amendment/change of employers filed before October). However, most of the time the agency approves them. 

Yes, there‚Äôs a chance that USCIS will not approve the amendment and ask questions about your H-1B approval but it‚Äôs also possible that they‚Äôll approve the amendment.

Too many lawyers say ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt sure this will be approved, so we don‚Äôt recommend the company file it‚Äù without really understanding the trends and chances. If the company you are trying to join has really conservative immigration lawyers, those lawyers may even be advising the company that they cannot file this kind of H-1B. I have seen lawyers all the time state that it is not possible to get approvals. But it is - I see it all the time, and other attorneys do too. There is nothing wrong with asking for an approval. 

So for those of you who were selected in the H-1B lottery in March, try to get your current employer to still file your H-1B petition. If you end up laid off this summer, push for your next employer to file an amendment with USCIS to at least give you a chance of keeping your lottery slot.

Post Date: You don‚Äôt need to write off PERM if you‚Äôre still early on in your immigration journey.

Especially if you‚Äôre still a student.

It just helps to have a backup plan in case PERM does not work out, which is why I suggest that current students and recent graduates spend time looking at alternatives like EB-2 NIW and even EB-1A (for those who can meet the criteria).

You‚Äôll need to do a lot more work to build your profile if you decide to pursue EB-2 NIW so do bear that in mind - the work you do, however, will benefit you not just by giving you more immigration options but also help build your network and your career.

So efforts to build your NIW profile are never wasted.

But still pursue those traditional methods. Definitely take the immigration benefits your employer offers.

While he doesn‚Äôt have too much in his profile that points to broader participation in his field (like publications and professional association memberships), he:

Something that can be accomplished through careful profile-building and working with someone who is familiar with the national interest factors.

Because you‚Äôve already presented your case a certain way to USCIS and as lawyers, we have to work within the framework that you presented.

And we only have 3 months (or less in many cases) to do it.

It also takes a lot more time to unpack everything you submitted on your own, some of which might be fine but some of which might have subsequently put you at a disadvantage.

A lawyer might still take on your case if you get an RFE or NOID, but for the most part you‚Äôll be paying almost as much as what it would have cost to retain that same lawyer in the first place.

But instead of getting the full benefit of presenting your best case right off the bat with the help of an experienced lawyer, you‚Äôll only get the partial benefit of presenting your best possible case within the framework that you set with your self-petition.

Post Date: Talked to someone in IT consulting last week.

In general, I‚Äôve been getting a lot more consulting clients who are reaching out because they want to apply for EB-2 NIW or EB-1A.

Many are senior leaders with years of experience and countless impressive contributions to their field, which means they may have the profile for EB-2 NIW or EB-1A.

Consulting firms sometimes get a bad rep, especially the IT consulting firms because they have a reputation for paying less than the full time employees at their client companies.

The kinds of experience these IT consultants get though is great because they get to work on all these high profile projects.

As a result, many can prove impact across multiple industries and for a wide variety of companies.

Many also end up becoming top professionals in a sub-field of IT consulting, and for these IT leaders EB-1A is a great option (in the process of doing a few of these). 

It‚Äôs not always apparent though that these individuals are a good fit, especially for EB-1A.

Looking at their CVs, it‚Äôs not always obvious that they‚Äôre EB-1A material because the resumes always talk in great technical detail but don‚Äôt necessarily highlight impact. But when I speak to them in consultations, that‚Äôs when it becomes apparent that they have been doing great work and have enough to claim five or even six criteria.

So senior level, leading IT consultants, definitely consider EB-2 NIW or EB-1A - you may already have the profile for one or both but just don‚Äôt know it yet (not really applicable for junior consultants, but for you, give it 5-10 years and then see where you stand).

Post Date: For clients whose chances of approval are less than 50%, I usually recommend that they profile-build instead of file right away.

This goes for both EB-1A and EB-2 NIW.

For EB-1A, cost is the reason for why you might want to wait until you‚Äôre able to build up your profile, which can take a few years (or longer, depends on your current profile). Cost also means time and the effort you put into preparing the case, which can be a lot. 

For EB-2 NIW, cost can also be an issue and it‚Äôs simply not worth it to file a weak case if all you need to strengthen your case is a few months of profile-building.

For NIW, it might be better to delay filing until you have a strong case, which for a lot of you who have a STEM master‚Äôs and some work experience is possible to build in 2-3 months, than file now and potentially get a denial in a few months (at which point it might be too late to profile-build and then refile).

Post Date: If you already have a priority date and are 6 months to a year from a strong EB-1A application, you probably don‚Äôt need EB-2 NIW.

You can still benefit from EB-2 NIW, but it‚Äôs not a must-have nor something that‚Äôs extremely beneficial.

If you‚Äôre already close to having a strong EB-1A case, you might want to just skip EB-2 NIW altogether and apply for EB-1A.

But on the flip side, if you are not close to EB-1A, you may benefit from an EB-2 NIW in the interim. Don‚Äôt discount it. Don‚Äôt treat it like a ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù either, because benefits are all that, but it is worth considering.

One of those fields you don‚Äôt usually think about when you think about NIW.

We recently filed an NIW petition for someone in this field - he doesn‚Äôt have any citations or publications but because his field of endeavor strongly aligns with national interests, he has a strong case.

Post Date: If you aren‚Äôt seeing any movement on your PERM process, it could mean:

- Your company is planning layoffs and have told their attorneys to pause their PERM program.
- There was an issue with another PERM at your company that impacts yours (for example, perhaps your company recently started hiring for a position similar to yours and found a bunch of minimally qualified U.S. workers).
- An error with your PERM - a government error, a typo or error.
- Just plain administrative delays (both at the law firm or at the government).

All sorts of things can happen during the PERM process, and to get as much insight as you can into your own PERM process, try to loop in someone higher up at your company if you aren‚Äôt getting answers.

Getting that buy-in from someone more senior could give you additional information on the status of your PERM if you start experiencing delays in the process (someone more senior at your company may be able to get access to information that affects your PERM).

You might also be able to speed things up with the help of someone higher up at the company or at least get a heads up on potential changes to your company‚Äôs PERM program.

Post Date: A lot of immigration consultants (non-lawyers) advise clients to:

- Apply to a master‚Äôs or certificate program.
- Get an F-1 visa.
- Apply for EB-2 NIW.
- Apply for the adjustment of status (I-485).
- Drop out before they get a final decision.

This happens more often than you think and if you‚Äôre about to go down this road, don‚Äôt.

Why?

Because EB-2 is no longer current, which means you‚Äôll have to stay in status for at least 6 months to a year before you can file an adjustment application.

What this means is you can‚Äôt just drop out of school even if you get an NIW approval, which gives you no special status whatsoever (the EB-2 NIW in itself does not give you status).

Also, even if your NIW is approved, the I-485 is not guaranteed to be approved. It‚Äôs safer to hold a backup status so that if the adjustment falls through, you can fix the issues and try again.

All this sounds obvious but so many immigrants fall victim to the false promise of a fast green card.

Post Date: If you don‚Äôt work in a field traditionally thought of as being in the national interest, you can still potentially qualify for EB-2 NIW by showing Exceptional Ability and some kind of unique ability to contribute to the country.

This route is about showing that what you propose to do is of substantial merit and that your proposed endeavor can significantly benefit the U.S. in your field simply because you are exceptional in your field.

In my own practice, I have not worked with too many clients on pursuing this kind of case as it can be extremely difficult to meet USCIS‚Äô standards through Exceptional Ability (for example, I once filed a case for someone who was at the time running a multi-million dollar logistics operation - he was denied). But I have worked with others such as artists and people running really interesting small businesses that were approved. 

So yes, it‚Äôs possible to pursue EB-2 NIW in a field that is not ‚Äúon the list‚Äù - it‚Äôs just much, much harder but still possible.

Post Date: Been doing a lot of consultations with clients who are planning for the future.

For many, their OPT is about to expire so they‚Äôre now looking for ways to stay in the U.S. 

O-1 is not really an option for many because they don‚Äôt have the profile.

Day 1 CPT program is an option.

There‚Äôs also the Open Avenues‚Äô fellowship for those that can convince their companies.

And finally, international assignment through their employers with a future transfer back to the U.S. through the L-1 visa.

Some people have the options for citizenship-based alternatives (TN, E-3, H-1B1, etc.) or dependent status (H-4, L-2, etc. EADs). Others may have super niche options. But most don‚Äôt. 

Yes, there are options if you are about to run out of OPT, but it‚Äôs best to avoid this situation entirely by preparing in advance.

Current students or recent graduates, start preparing now for alternatives to H-1B, such as:

- Building an O-1 profile.
- Applying for EB-2 NIW to secure a priority date (if you‚Äôre Rest of World).

Post Date: USCIS knows about the PERM disaster.

They know that the Department of Labor is backlogged to no end.

They know about the layoffs.

So talented people in the U.S. who have:

- Almost maxed out their H-1B, and
- Can't get PERM filed because their company's PERM program is on hold + backlogs,

Are having a hard time staying in the U.S., even if they are exceptional. 

This is why (I think) we're seeing such high NIW approval rates in recent years.

Not saying UCIS is going to approve anybody who applies, but in this adjudication climate,

Even once-borderline cases appear to be getting approved.

Post Date: Got an EB-2 NIW RFE last week for a pilot client.

I was honestly surprised to get an RFE for him considering the strength of his profile (I‚Äôve been able to get approvals for many of his peers - their profiles are not quite as strong).

Looks like the officer is preparing  to deny the case, and we may need to refile.

This kind of thing also happened with one of my strongest cases recently. Sometimes the ‚Äúweak‚Äù ones go through with no RFE, and the strong ones get challenged.

Yes, USCIS can be arbitrary with its decisions as different officers can have different standards for the same immigration benefit - in this case, we drew a strict officer with very high standards for EB-2 NIW. The officer is saying my client needs to show that he has been ‚Äúan impetus for progress‚Äù in his field by contributing to the entire field. This isn‚Äôt a requirement for EB-2 NIW. But some officers quote it as if it is.

The problem with Js?

You may have to return back to your home country for at least two years after residing in the U.S.

If you want to say go for a green card while on a J, you‚Äôll either have to return to your home country and work there for 2 years as part of the program‚Äôs requirements or go through a lengthy waiver process (which can waive this return requirement but is a lot of work and a waiver is not guaranteed).

Yes, J-visas are cap exempt and are easier to get, but if you‚Äôre a foreign medical professional who wants to eventually live in the U.S., you‚Äôre far better off going for O-1 or a cap-exempt H-1B.

At least with the O-1 or cap-exempt H-1B, you‚Äôll be more in control of your immigration future and be subject to fewer requirements when you then apply for your National Interest Waiver green card.

This also applies to all other foreign professionals who are thinking about partaking in a J-visa program. J visa programs are convenient and pretty great for short term plans, but always think about the future implications.

Post Date: USCIS explicitly states that my field is a field of national interest - does that mean I‚Äôll automatically qualify for EB-2 NIW?

No.

You might have a strong case, especially if you already have:

- Evidence of professional participation.
- A strong proposed endeavor.
- Research and citations (can help, but depends on your profile and the nature of your research accomplishments).

But just because you have all of the above does not mean you‚Äôll automatically qualify.

You‚Äôll still have to make an argument through a strong petition, which is important to get right. Especially the third prong where you do a balancing test for USCIS to show why the normal protections for U.S. workers don‚Äôt really apply to your situation. 

USCIS also has a lot of discretion when it comes to EB-2 NIW, which is why you sometimes see all kinds of nonsensical RFEs and even NOIDs (yes, even a strong NIW case can get an RFE and knowing how to respond can make a difference to the outcome of your case).

This is where an experienced lawyer can make a difference to your case.

Post Date: It is possible to get approved for EB-2 NIW while on F-1 or J-1.

You do however have to take into account the possibility that you‚Äôll still need to shift to a dual intent immigrant visa like H-1B or O-1 (this depends on how early you apply for and get approved for EB-2 NIW and on the EB-2 backlog for your country - for India or China, while getting a priority date early is useful, you‚Äôll definitely need H-1B or O-1).

If you do intend on applying for EB-2 NIW while on F-1 or J-1, it‚Äôs best to speak with an experienced lawyer to go over the potential impact of your NIW application. You‚Äôll want to talk about:

- Your travel plans (having an approved I-140 on an F-1 or J-1 may make travel difficult).
- Your family situation.
- Your work plans.
- Your J-1 sponsor‚Äôs policies. 

USCIS has confirmed that an approved I-140 will not interfere with STEM extensions, at least not while you are physically present in the U.S. 

There isn‚Äôt similar confirmation for J-1, and I know of some J-1 sponsors that won‚Äôt issue extensions for people once they have their I-140s approved. Some will, but some won‚Äôt.

Post Date: You can write the best petition.

But sometimes, USCIS simply won‚Äôt read it.

For this particular case, they looked at a particular document we submitted and said that nothing in it (the document, not the case) was evidence of extraordinary ability.

This was supposed to be the document explaining all the other documents we had attached to the petition, each of which shows in painstaking detail that my client meets the criteria.

Sometimes, USCIS takes things out of context and simply hits you with a nasty RFE because they can‚Äôt be bothered to review the case.

The only thing you can do is reply with a letter not citing more evidence, but instead explaining that all the evidence needed to adjudicate the case was already included in the original submission.

The bar is lower (than say EB-1A or EB-2 NIW) but it still takes a lot of time and work to meet the criteria.

Here‚Äôs a clip from one of our weekly livestreams where I cover the basics of O-1 and the different scenarios under which you could qualify for an O-1 (link in the comments!).

Just remember that you still need the involvement of your employer in the process, which can be a barrier to some of you out there as your company‚Äôs lawyer may not be open to employee-driven O-1s (probably because of the high rate of O-1 denials from the previous administration - still a fresh memory in the minds of many big firm immigration lawyers).

Post Date: I got my first pilot NIW approved!

The case was from a while back and the pilot had decided to go with me instead of another lawyer based on a personal recommendation from one of my prior clients.

The case was approved in three months without premium processing and also without a ton of documentation.

The whole process was smooth.

Of course, it helped that my client was extremely qualified. She had over ten years of industry experience, top notch credentials, and also evidence to show that she had made contributions to the field. She was a legit professional in every way.

Not saying that every pilot who applies for NIW will qualify, just like not every nurse or engineer who applies for an NIW will qualify, but in recent years, aviation professionals have been getting approved for NIWs.

The trend started a couple years ago when a few attorneys stepped forward to say that their clients had gotten approved. Ever since then, pilots have been applying and getting approved!

Post Date: Recently spoke with Open Avenues.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know what Open Avenues is, it‚Äôs a way for those who didn‚Äôt get selected in the H-1B lottery to stay in the U.S. through their unique cap-exempt H-1B fellowship program.

If you‚Äôre selected as a fellow, they petition for you and since they‚Äôre a nonprofit affiliated with universities or other qualified partners, they‚Äôre not subject to the H-1B cap.

You‚Äôre also allowed to keep your full time job with your current employer as long as your employer is willing to enter an agreement with Open Avenues.

All of this comes at a cost to the employer that you should be prepared to discuss with your manager, but if your employer is on board and you know they‚Äôd love to keep you at the company, you should definitely bring this up to see if there might be a way for you to stay in the U.S. through the fellowship program.

Will talk more about this in an upcoming livestream (access available through my Discord community).

Post Date: If you have a borderline case, I would not suggest that you file for EB-2 NIW immediately.

Even with the upcoming election.

Why?

Because chances are you‚Äôll get an RFE and by the time you decide on whether to reply to the RFE or refile, you might not have enough time left to work on your profile, strengthen your case, and refile.

So instead of rushing to file, get an attorney to evaluate your case first before deciding on whether to file now or profile-build for 2-3 months and then file.

Post Date: I sometimes take over cases from other lawyers. 

Many times, a client seeks me out for a second opinion, either because they don‚Äôt believe their original lawyer‚Äôs approach or because they ended up in a situation that they did not think their original lawyer could handle well (like getting a nasty RFE).

On a few occasions, I actually come in at the RFE stage.

Usually, I don‚Äôt find fault with the original lawyer‚Äôs approach because there are a dozen ways to file cases, none of them being the ‚Äúright‚Äù way. But I do usually develop a different angle of approach for the cases that increase their chances of getting approved. 

I also need to be persuaded based on the facts that my client has a strong shot because if I can‚Äôt be persuaded, USCIS will most likely not be persuaded as well.

Post Date: Self-petitioning can work for some people.

For some of you who can‚Äôt afford a lawyer, it might be your only option.

For those of you who do have the option of hiring a lawyer, think carefully about whether you want to self-petition.

I get on consultations all the time with self-petitioners who share what they‚Äôre planning on submitting to USCIS.

The thing with immigration law? There are a lot of unknown unknowns that you are only made aware of with years of experience.

When I review petitions written without the help of a lawyer, it‚Äôs therefore no surprise that I come across huge gaps. Omissions that usually can cost the self-petitioner their case.

Petitions written by applicants also tend to be far less concise.

Some are also simply statements of facts and don‚Äôt make an argument at all as to why the applicant is qualified for the immigration benefit to which they‚Äôve applied.

Of course, there‚Äôs always the chance that you get an officer who approves your case even if your petition is not up to scratch. I‚Äôve seen this happen before and I‚Äôm not saying it never happens.

I‚Äôm just saying that if you self-petition, be prepared for the possibility that your petition ends up in the hands of a strict officer who denies your case not because of profile weakness but because you did not properly argue your case.

I‚Äôm not trying to bash self-petitioners (because I totally understand the drive, and sometimes the financial need, to DIY) - I‚Äôm just saying that there‚Äôs always that chance that you get a strict officer who immediately notices that you wrote your own petition and then starts nitpicking so they can issue an RFE or even NOID.

A scenario that you could have completely avoided had you gone with an experienced lawyer who gets your case approved even with a strict officer because the petition was properly constructed.

Post Date: Anyone without a priority date should seriously consider NIW this year.

Especially if you‚Äôre in tech (USCIS policies as of now are incredibly tech friendly) and your company is still in the middle of layoffs.

Because who knows if you‚Äôre going to be able to get PERM through your company.

Why not take matters into your own hands if you can and get a priority date without the need for a company to sponsor you?

Post Date: If I‚Äôm planning to apply for EB-2 NIW, should I work at a small company or a large company?

A small company could potentially give you:

- Access to a role with a lot of responsibility early on, which can definitely boost your EB-2 NIW profile.
- Access to more senior leaders at your company who can recommend you.
- Access to work that can make an impact on your company and even your field, especially if you‚Äôre engaged in research.

But you might be able to get all of the above from a larger company as well (at some of the FAANGs, for example, you might very early on in your career get the chance to work on a product that will be widely used and have high impact).

There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer - your decision on where to work should be based not just on the size of the company but also other factors like what kind of work you‚Äôll be doing there, who you‚Äôll be working with, etc., and how they fit into your overall career trajectory and also how you want to present your EB-2 NIW case.

How?

Applying for EB-2 NIW right after graduation (from a master‚Äôs) or even while on the first year of OPT.

With EB-2 NIW, there is a chance that you can advance through the backlog for green cards and adjust status to permanent residence before needing H-1B (although for some of you out there, you may still need H-1B because the backlogs are unpredictable, especially if you are not filing immediately on graduation).

Best to arrive prepared with all the paperwork you‚Äôll need and a lawyer to help you kickstart the marriage-based green card process.

Usually, a K-1 visa to marriage-based green card is the first step.

But after you enter, just try to get everything done within 90 days from point of entry.

If you end up falling out of status and can‚Äôt get everything filed in 90 days, you‚Äôll usually be forgiven by USCIS but it‚Äôs best to start your green card process early so you can file the green card paperwork ASAP after the wedding, before your status on the I-94 expires.

Post Date: I get it - you don‚Äôt want to stir the pot when you first join a company.

But if you want to make sure things go smoothly for you on your green card journey, you need to get your company to start your green card process as soon as possible.

I tell many of my clients to try to get their employer to include something about the green card process in their offer of employment.

And for employers that refuse to grant your ask or at least work with you on a reasonable timeline, you‚Äôre better off walking away and finding a company that will support you in your immigration journey.

Having a company that supports you on your green card journey versus one that is not supportive can make a huge difference.

Trust me - it‚Äôll save you from a world of stress.

Post Date: What can you do as a master‚Äôs student right now to build up a profile for EB-2 NIW?

Just get really involved.
 
Get really involved in your area that you‚Äôre majoring in and start thinking about a niche to specialize in.

Also start looking into organizations to join where you can have high quality contact and where you know you‚Äôll have access to:

- Volunteer opportunities (at local meetups related to your field).
- Work with mentors.
- Opportunities to write articles.
- Attend conferences.
- Opportunities to participate in committees (the new members committee, for example).

The connections that you develop and the network you develop through these organizations will help you with profile-building activities as a student and also once you graduate.

A lot of students who are actively involved in organizations related to their field and can show in-depth participation throughout the course of their studies may even be qualified to apply for EB-2 NIW right after graduation, especially if they have a job offer lined up at a company that does work in a field of national interest.

In addition to being good for immigration, profile-building activities can also be great for your career in general and also eventually for EB-1A if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre planning to look into after securing a priority date.

USCIS is also obligated to follow the recent administration‚Äôs executive order, something that‚Äôs stated clearly in the USCIS Policy Manual.

That being said, you still need to point to the executive order in your case to make sure USCIS does take it into consideration.

As long as your attorney makes a good argument about how your work in AI ties into national priorities, you‚Äôll have a strong case.

Post Date: Just a few years ago, if you were an international student thinking about staying in the U.S., your first instinct would be to rely on an employer as a way to eventually get a green card.

Now, with layoffs, PERM backlogs, and indefinite pauses on PERM programs (some major companies have even officially confirmed these pauses), as an international student you might want to start looking at a backup plan as soon as possible.

If you‚Äôre Rest of World (not an Indian or Chinese national), start looking into EB-2 NIW, especially if you‚Äôre doing a STEM master‚Äôs as you may be eligible to apply and secure a priority date right after graduation.

Some of you might not even need a temporary work visa like H-1B or O-1 if you get NIW while on OPT.

If you‚Äôre a Chinese national, EB-2 NIW still makes sense as it will considerably shorten your wait for a green card. You‚Äôll still, however, need a work visa like H-1B. EB-1A is also worth looking into for the long term.

If you‚Äôre an Indian national, EB-2 NIW is also something you should look into just so you can quickly secure a priority date and not have to rely on an employer to complete a PERM within 2 years. You‚Äôll still need a work visa like H-1B and in the long term you‚Äôll want to look into EB-1A.

Post Date: A lot of potential NIW applicants come to me with not much more than just work experience from their job.

They come to me to ask if there‚Äôs some broad-brush, general approach that will work for them and make them NIW ready.

Yes, and no.

Yes in the sense that the answer is almost always more professional involvement.

No in the sense that doing a bunch of random professional activities that have nothing to do with a proposed endeavor will not be effective.

What an ideal NIW profile looks like varies heavily by individual.

If you can, work with a lawyer or talk to someone who‚Äôs gone through the NIW process to know if you‚Äôre on the right track.

Do regular check-ins and don‚Äôt just work on your case in a vacuum without outside input.

Also be prepared to do a lot of work because it is a lot of work to pursue NIW when you are starting from scratch with just that master‚Äôs degree done.

But its benefits can mean both mental and immigration freedom for you, especially for those of you who are Rest of World and are tired of waiting for PERM to come through.

Post Date: For Indian and Chinese nationals, NIW will not make the green card process faster.

But that doesn‚Äôt make it a route to ignore.

First, it‚Äôs a far more ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù classification than EB-1A (by definition alone most of you will not qualify for EB-1A because you have to be at the top of your field and not everyone can be at the top).

Second, there are still benefits to NIW:

‚Ä¢ Flexibility in changing jobs. Imagine having the freedom to change jobs as you please and not have to stay at a company simply because you‚Äôre in the middle of a PERM process. With NIW, you can pick up and move jobs anytime you want.
‚Ä¢ Being able to get a priority date and move quickly when it becomes current. 2020‚Äôs sudden advancement of priority dates was unlikely to begin with, but it still happened. Who knows what might happen in the near future - perhaps we might get a 2020-like advancement again. Better to have a priority date now than to be stuck in a PERM process and not be able to benefit from any kind of sudden, unexpected priority date advancements.

So if you‚Äôre an Indian or Chinese national, while NIW will not shorten your green card wait, you‚Äôll still benefit from NIW. Especially if you don‚Äôt currently have a priority date!

Post Date: Do I have to have an offer from a FAANG company (or equivalent) to have a strong EB-2 NIW case?

No, definitely no.

There are so many companies in the U.S. that are nowhere near in size to any of the FAANGs and yet are still doing work that is of national importance.

In the Boston area, for example, there are a lot of biomedical startups that are researching things that are undeniably of national importance. In the field of cybersecurity, there are a lot of small companies that are doing groundbreaking work.

A FAANG job offer is nice and name recognition is something that USCIS takes into account but is not at all necessary.

As long as you‚Äôve done the work to build your profile and can show that you are going to be working at a company that is doing work that is of national importance or has at least some recognition in an area of national importance (does not have to be name recognition - a substitute could be raising a large funding round to help grow the company), you should be in a good position to file.

You might even have a stronger profile than someone who has not yet built up their profile and only has the FAANG job offer.

Post Date: Layoffs can derail your green card plans.

Spoke to someone recently and he‚Äôs spent 3 years trying to just start a PERM:

- He joined a company in 2022 but was laid off.
- He joined another company in 2023 but was again laid off.
- He‚Äôs now at another company in 2024, which may be planning layoffs soon given the current state of the tech industry.

For this particular individual (and for anyone in his kind of situation), he‚Äôll really need to think about alternatives to PERM as even if he does not get laid off, because if his company does experience layoffs they‚Äôll most likely put PERM on hold even for the employees that remain.

For those of you who have just started H-1B or are a few years in, definitely start planning for backup options like EB-2 NIW or even EB-1A (if you qualify) because given what‚Äôs been happening, PERM is no longer as reliable a path as it once was to a priority date.

Post Date: Having a PhD can significantly help your EB-2 NIW case, especially if it‚Äôs in a STEM field.

Not so much for EB-1A unless you‚Äôre presenting a researcher-based or academia-focused case and that PhD has been the base of a strong authorship profile.

Keep in mind though that USCIS only takes your PhD into consideration if you‚Äôve already earned the qualification.

So if possible, try to file for EB-2 NIW after you get your PhD.

If you‚Äôre getting your PhD this summer or fall, I‚Äôd suggest waiting till you get your PhD before applying for EB-2 NIW.

If you‚Äôre expecting to get your PhD later than this upcoming fall, I‚Äôd suggest weighing the benefits of filing before the election when things might change with EB-2 NIW, or waiting and filing after with that key qualification as part of your petition. 

It‚Äôs not a clear cut choice for most people.

Post Date: If you‚Äôre Rest of World (born anywhere except India or China), you should still be looking at EB-1A.

That is, if you‚Äôre already qualified for EB-1A.

If you‚Äôre not, I would recommend EB-2 NIW because the standards are generally much lower and the backlog is still not too long.

Why?

Because if you are already demonstrably extraordinary, it‚Äôs much faster and more importantly, the timeline is more predictable in the EB-1A category.

But if you‚Äôre not yet ready and are just looking at working towards it, building a profile for EB-1A is no small feat and for some can take years. Why wait years to file when you could just wait in the EB-2 NIW backlog for those same years?

This only applies if you‚Äôre Rest of World - if you‚Äôre from China or India, you‚Äôll have to deal with a much longer EB-2 backlog (especially for India). Profile building for China or India-born people is much more important for long term immigration strategy.

Post Date: If you‚Äôre paying an employer to hire you and think that‚Äôs a valid visa route, think twice.

Remember the Integra Technologies scandal? Or Findream before it?

I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of ‚Äútraining and placement programs‚Äù disguised as employment opportunities that are really just pay-to-play schemes that don‚Äôt lead to any real visa options (but appear to lead somewhere). The worst part is that many of these schemes are actually perceived as legitimate to Gen Z and are becoming mainstream in the job market even outside of the immigration world. Recent grads are at high risk, but the older generations don‚Äôt know how mainstream and accepted these arrangements are. 

USCIS hasn‚Äôt issued very much guidance on this just yet (they really should since it‚Äôs becoming more of a trouble), but know that it‚Äôs a problem. Even if your social media circles all say this is a normal way to get a job, just know that the older generations have no idea why this would ever be considered legitimate. They automatically think ‚Äúfraud.‚Äù

Remember - if you‚Äôre paying an employer, even if it‚Äôs at the start of your ‚Äúemployer-employee‚Äù relationship, even if it‚Äôs for training, you‚Äôre opening yourself up to fraud allegations from USCIS, which will significantly hurt your future chances of qualifying for any sort of visa option that will allow you to stay in the U.S.

Post Date: There‚Äôs this misconception that in order to qualify for NIW, you need to specialize as soon as possible.

Not true.

You‚Äôll need to profile-build, as in start showing evidence of broader participation in your field and projects that show potential broader impact.

But not all of your activities have to be specifically focused on your proposed endeavor (for example, if your proposed endeavor has something to do with AI, judging a non-AI hackathon is not wasted evidence. It will still help).

That being said, having some evidence of accomplishments and achievements that relate to the very specific sub-field mentioned in your proposed endeavor can help.

Balance the broad qualifications with the niche qualifications. It‚Äôs good to have both.

And people deserve individual attention.

Not cookie-cutter services as offered by many law firms that don‚Äôt represent the interests of immigrants.

It‚Äôs not completely their fault - immigrants have time and time again been told that the best way to get to stay in this country is through H-1B, which can be pretty standardized.

While true to some extent, there are so many other options out there like NIW and O-1 for which you can build a personal profile. You just need to know how and receive the right guidance.

Post Date: Lawyer NIWs can be difficult, but are still possible.

I have worked with foreign-qualified lawyers in the past and helped them get NIW.

They‚Äôre generally already highly qualified lawyers with the skills and experiences to pursue their proposed endeavor, not so much fresh law school graduates.

It can be difficult too to do these kinds of cases because law school graduates only get 1 year of OPT.

If you are a law school graduate and want to pursue NIW, definitely start profile-building as soon as you can, perhaps even a few years before you are set to graduate.

Also have a proposed endeavor in mind and clear reasoning for how you intend to pursue it as well as evidence that shows that you are qualified.

We filed an EB-1A for a director in data science.

We filed an EB-2 NIW for someone who specializes in AI.

We‚Äôre also working on an EB-2 NIW for someone who‚Äôll be filing both EB-2 NIW and EB-1A. This is a popular route for some who qualify for both as you can use the same materials for both applications.

The final product for both though is not the same and different approaches are still required.

Post Date: If you can, avoid making H-1B your only visa option.

Because you‚Äôre subject to restrictions like:

‚Ä¢ The 60 day rule.
‚Ä¢ Not being able to leave your employer without finding a job almost immediately.

It‚Äôs stressful having your entire immigration future tied to an employer, especially with all these layoffs that are happening (and more apparently to come in 2024).

And even after H-1B, you‚Äôre still tied to your employer via PERM. Yes, you can technically change employers but you again risk losing status.

For those of you early on in the green card process, I can talk more in the Discord community about what you can do right now to equip yourself with more options down the line.

That being said, try to look for recent examples and not at examples of what worked years ago. Things have changed a lot for EB-2 NIW and O-1!

To help profile-builders, I‚Äôve been spending hours developing in my paid Discord a body of material that I‚Äôve been continually updating to provide insight into what makes a strong O-1, EB-1A, and NIW profile.

The idea is to equip you, the applicant, with the right guidance on what you can do to strengthen your case profile and maximize your approval chances.

Post Date: Your employer can be a great source of profile-building opportunities.

I‚Äôve seen this work in the pharmaceutical industry. One client I‚Äôve been coaching for the past few months on profile-building asked her company to see if there were professional organizations she could join and in which to get involved.

Turns out they were already sponsoring a few organizations or had corporate level memberships, so they allowed her to join as a representative of the company.

She got a membership card and was listed on their website as a member (which we were able to use as evidence).

One of these organizations was also planning a conference, which she was able to attend. She participated, built her network, and from it was also able to get a couple of notes from attendees mentioning that they saw her there and how good it was to meet her.

She also published something on Medium and put out a press release about her own career that was picked up by a smaller news agency.

When we filed, she was able to file with a strong profile built on her authorship pieces, media exposure, and professional involvement through her membership at various professional organizations.

Her EB-2 NIW case was quickly approved.

As expected, all kinds of sub-fields are coming out of AI and similar tech that USCIS is seeing as in the national interest.

Goes to show that there are sub-fields in these hot fields where you can stand out and show USCIS that you are making a unique impact.

This goes not just for NIW, but for EB-1A as well.

Post Date: Is your H-1B max-out date a few short years away?

Definitely look at NIW as a backup plan in case:

- Your company starts experiencing layoffs.
- The PERM backlog stops you from getting a priority date.

NIW is not something you urgently need right now but for a lot of you out there (especially Rest of World),

It's actually a great way to get a green card without having to go through PERM.

Post Date: She told her employer that she got approved for EB-2 NIW.

They did not seem to know much about EB-2 NIW and asked her for a copy of her I-140 filing to make sure it ‚Äúmatched up‚Äù with her H-1B.

Employees, this is not something you have to give to your employer (matching is not required).

Especially if what you put in your NIW may affect your employment with your current employer.

For example, a lot of EB-2 NIWs hint at an applicant‚Äôs interest in working at other companies in their field, which is something you definitely do not want to share with your current employer. Or the petitions might describe extensive work with nonprofits and volunteer organizations, which the employer may think detracts from productivity in your role.

So if you get an EB-2 NIW approval and your employer asks for a copy of your filing, you do not have to give them a copy.

If you do give them a copy, you might have to explain some things.

Post Date: If you‚Äôre a bachelor‚Äôs degree holder with five years of experience, and are a few years from your H-1B max-out date, you may still want to apply for NIW.

Regardless of where you‚Äôre from, filing for NIW can be a good decision if you want to quickly get a priority date without needing to rely on PERM.

The closer you get to your max-out date (without a priority date), the more it makes sense to file for NIW (assuming you have a strong profile).

For some of you a year or two years away from max-out without PERM, NIW may be one of your only options to stay in the U.S.

Certifications on their own can meet one of the three criteria under exceptional ability, but remember that you‚Äôll still be subject to a final merits determination where USCIS will look at all factors to do with your case. 

If your case is weak in other areas, having certifications alone will not help your case as much as you think they will.

Post Date: Does it make sense to go for EB-2 NIW if you‚Äôre still on OPT?

Regardless of your nationality, yes.

Because if you‚Äôre serious about getting a green card, you‚Äôll essentially be removing a major obstacle to getting a green card - getting a priority date.

With PERM backlogs right now and layoffs (which have meant stalled PERM programs for many big employers), for some of you out there EB-2 NIW will be the fastest way to a priority date.

If you were on OPT, once you get EB-2 NIW, all you‚Äôll need is to get another status after your OPT expires to keep working in the U.S. (like H-1B or O-1). Some of you might be able to get the green card before your OPT expires (not India or China-born, but others). But there are backlogs for everyone so expect to need the other work visa after OPT.

Once you have that other work visa like H-1B, you‚Äôll be able to use the priority date that you got through your EB-2 NIW to file for an adjustment. For Rest of World it should be relatively fast. India or China-born applicants will have longer delays.

Link is in the comments.

For those of you who sign up, you‚Äôll be considered for a key benefit that I have not offered to prospective clients, and that‚Äôs a refundable case (if you graduate from the course).

Other benefits of the course include:

- A lifetime of support through our Discord community - once you take the course, you‚Äôll have permanent access to a Discord channel where I‚Äôll continue to answer your questions and provide guidance until you file your AOS for the green card.
- A personalized action plan and proposed endeavor statement, which will form the core of your NIW profile-building plan. We will continually refine your statement throughout the course.
- Access to a community of like-minded individuals who are committed to building strong profiles for NIW.

With this course, assuming you do all the work that‚Äôs required, you‚Äôll be ready to file in months and before the end of the year, which is when things may change for EB-2 NIW.

Ready to sign-up? Join the waitlist using the link in the comments and we'll notify you if you're selected to be a part of the first cohort! Also, feel free to message or email me if you have any questions.

Is the basic question that USCIS is asking every step of the way.

Your NIW case and profile need to show that you are uniquely qualified and positioned to make some contribution that merits a waiver of the labor certification requirement.

A major need for individuals with your skillset is one way to strengthen the case for granting a waiver.

Uniqueness of skill coupled with a compelling application of that skill to the advancement of national interests? Even better.

Just have this question in mind when you‚Äôre profile-building because USCIS sure will have this question in mind when evaluating your NIW profile.

And that‚Äôs fine.

Remember that to be able to qualify for EB-1A, you need to be ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù and at the top of your field. Some of you might truly be at the top of your field but for a lot of you, even with years of work you may not be able to meet enough of the criteria.

Not saying you shouldn‚Äôt try (because ultimately if you are from India, it is the best option) - just remember that it‚Äôs not EB-1A or nothing.

Even if you can get NIW, you‚Äôll be able to secure benefits that will give you far more control over your immigration future than PERM ever will. And the laws are bound to change at some point. Maybe not in the next 5-6 years, but probably in the next 10-20 years. The 90+ year projected wait time is an estimate based on current policy, not the final say.

So don‚Äôt think all is lost if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll qualify for EB-1A in the near future.

Post Date: ‚ÄúDo I qualify for EB-2 NIW‚Äù is a question I get all the time.

Almost as if there are certain boxes that you have to check that once checked means you‚Äôre qualified.

That‚Äôs not how EB-2 NIW works.

It‚Äôs about making an argument, answering all the ‚Äúwhy questions‚Äù that USCIS will be asking about your case, such as:

Why you‚Äôre in a position to advance an area of national interest.
Why you have a unique enough profile to merit a waiver of the labor certification requirement.

Foundational to a strong argument is a legal approach that brings all the pieces of your profile together to answer these questions.

You‚Äôll also need to describe your future plans in the U.S. - your proposed endeavor.

So when people ask me if they‚Äôre qualified, I usually shift that discussion to a balancing analysis of the strong factors versus the weak factors of the case.

Post Date: Currently at the RMV listening to a government employee trying to explain license eligibility to an elderly immigrant.

The RMV employee is wrong.

PSA: Don't ever let a government employee give you legal advice. From USCIS officers to RMV employees, they are usually wrong. They only get trained on a very small part of the document processing and are armed with a "we are the law!" mindset. Get legal advice from an attorney who is on your side.

Post Date: I‚Äôll be hosting another livestream this Wednesday at 6:30 PM EDT to answer questions about my EB-2 NIW profile-building course, NIW Ready (link in the comments or on my profile).

We‚Äôre now midway through the course with our first cohort and several cohort members have made strong progress on building their EB-2 NIW profiles. For example:

- One member recently found an AI advisor position with a local university.
- One member was recently accepted into a fellowship program.
- One member was recently invited to judge an awards ceremony.

When it comes to profile-building, a lot of it comes down to messaging or emailing people in your field, which is a skill that we continuously help members develop throughout the course. This applies to not just EB-2 NIW but EB-1A as well.

Interested in building your EB-2 NIW profile and filing before the upcoming election, which is when things might change with EB-2 NIW?

Have questions about the course?

Feel free to join Wednesday‚Äôs questions livestream! You can also find more information about NIW Ready and join the waitlist for our next cohort by visiting our course page! (link in the comments)

Post Date: Professionals in the creative fields can qualify for EB-2 NIW.

STEM is not a hard requirement.

In fact, a lot of these cases can be strong in the context of cultural exchange and contributions to the U.S.

For example, and this is based on some artist cases I worked on early on in my practice, you might be working on spreading a new art style in the U.S. by sharing your work and educating people who are interested in learning more.

Yes, with all the focus on AI EB-2 NIWs getting approved, it can make it seem like you need to be highly technical and doing some cool work in tech to get approved,

But that‚Äôs absolutely not the case.

Post Date: Her company‚Äôs PERM program is currently on hold with plans to restart the program in 2025.

At this point, it‚Äôll take at least three years before she gets her green card (without this delay, she would have had her green card now).

We‚Äôre now looking into NIW as an option, a backup option and perhaps even her only way to a priority date should her company continue to stall on PERM.

Many of you are probably in this situation right now:

- Company‚Äôs PERM is on hold.
- You‚Äôre on H-1B and with every year, you get closer to your max-out date.

If this is you, definitely look into NIW and start profile-building now if you want to explore another path to a priority date.

Post Date: Profile-building for EB-2 NIW does not mean manufacturing a whole profile that is not true to your career interests.

You don‚Äôt need to approach profile-building in this way. And you shouldn‚Äôt. 

Focus on a field and activities within it that‚Äôs of genuine interest to you.

If that field is not a field of national interest, think about ways you can explore overlaps between your field and fields that are related to national interest priorities.

For example, I‚Äôve worked with clients who have degrees in ‚ÄúDesign‚Äù, and this is an arts degree, not STEM. They are artists at heart. But in addition to creating art they also improve the functionality and design of apps and work for company‚Äôs well known in the high tech industry. They give talks on improving user experience through design. They are leveraging their passion for art in a way that we can show they are advancing national priorities by improving human-computer interfaces (HCI). It works well in the NIW context.

Post Date: While teaching is in itself not a great proposed endeavor for EB-2 NIW, teaching as a special assistant in universities or through online mentorship in your field can still be a great addition to your profile.

Why?

Evidence of professional participation. 

With the rise of online mentorship platforms, getting involved in your professional community through mentorship of younger, more junior professionals in your field is easier than ever, which is why I sometimes recommend it as a profile-building activity.

You also get to build your professional network, which can lead to even more opportunities to contribute to your field (which can boost your EB-2 NIW profile).

Post Date: Just because you want to qualify for O-1, NIW, or EB-1 does not mean you are ‚Äúprofile-ready.‚Äù

That‚Äôs because you still need to meet stringent criteria that can take years of making the right moves.

To help those of you who are early on in your careers and are interested in taking control of your own immigration future, I‚Äôve decided to host a paid livestream to answer all your questions.

I aim to make this a weekly livestream. Pricing is $20 per month for maximum accessibility. 

This is not a course nor is it some sort of magic bullet - it is a forum where you can ask me questions about O-1, NIW, or EB-1 and I can provide informed, general answers based on years of experience handling these types of cases. You can also benefit from answers to others‚Äô questions.

While the answers I give to questions won‚Äôt be legal advice (don‚Äôt think the general statements apply to you specifically without asking an attorney for individualized advice), the answers will still point you in the right direction based on my years of experience handling thousands of cases and advocating for all kinds of individuals.

Comment the word ‚Äúlivestream‚Äù and I will send you the link to the livestream, which is currently scheduled for next Thursday (12/14) at 11:30 AM EST.

Post Date: If you plan on job-hopping, regardless of nationality EB-2 NIW makes sense.

With an EB-2 NIW approval, you essentially have the key to a priority date, which you can use once you secure H-1B (this would apply more to Indian and Chinese nationals who want to extend their H-1B indefinitely and not be subject to that 6-year maximum) or even while you‚Äôre still on OPT (for those who are Rest of World and have enough time left on OPT to potentially file an adjustment application after waiting a couple of years to become current in the backlog).

With a priority date secured without the need for PERM, you no longer need to tie yourself to a company long term - once you get H-1B (or even while you‚Äôre on OPT), you‚Äôll be able to move companies without having to consider what that company is going to do to support your long term immigration plans.

Job-hopping has become an increasingly hot topic in recent months, especially with layoffs. 

It‚Äôs no longer as ‚Äúweird‚Äù as it used to be, especially with layoffs becoming a normal part of the corporate landscape and PERM becoming increasingly difficult to get because of the PERM backlogs and also because many companies are still laying off employees or considering layoffs in the near future.

Post Date: For most of you, H-1B is better than O-1 (unless you plan on starting your own company and getting O-1 that way).

Here are some downsides to O-1:

- Difficult to extend - for some of you, O-1 extensions will be by one year increments although there are ways to up that to three year increments.
- Not a long term status - the longer you stay on O-1, the more likely you‚Äôll be flagged by USCIS for having immigrant intent while on a nonimmigrant visa. It‚Äôs a small risk but it does exist.
- Grace period - if you get laid off on H-1B, you can easily do a transfer during your grace period and even have the option to change status to B-2 to extend your job search time in the U.S.. Much harder/less advisable to do that on O-1.

Here are some benefits to O-1:

- No restrictions on self-employment if you do everything right.
- A great backup if you don‚Äôt get H-1B through the lottery.
- A great alternative if H-1B is not an option for you because what you do does not fit into the speciality occupation criteria.

So there are some benefits to O-1 but if you plan on working for an established U.S. company, you‚Äôll most likely be better off on H-1B.

Post Date: Given that layoffs have become normal in the corporate landscape, I expect more immigrants to start applying for EB-2 NIW because a company to them may no longer be the key to a priority date.

Back in the day, PERM took six months.

Now?

PERM for most will take at least two years to process.

During those months, you could:

- Get laid off.
- Not get laid off but because others got laid off, have to deal with a pause on PERM and sometimes a restart back to square one (companies that experience layoffs tend to pause their PERM programs and are sometimes forced to pause them).

Not saying you should not have your company file a PERM for you but always be on the lookout for other ways to get a priority date.

For most of you out there who just graduated or are a few years into your career, that‚Äôs most likely going to be EB-2 NIW unless you can show proof of extraordinary ability and are an Indian or Chinese national (in which case EB-1A would make more sense).

Post Date: Get independence from PERM.

NIW is a way to employment freedom in the sense that as an immigrant, you‚Äôll no longer be tied down to an employer because of a pending PERM.

For many of our clients, this has meant the ability to leave a job that was not a good fit, accept a dream job offer, or simply explore a different part of their field without having to think about whether that might affect their green card plans.

Things used to be different. 

Back when PERM took 6 months, immigrant employees could get PERM and then move on to a different company when it was time for a natural transition. 

Now PERM takes almost 2 years and being stuck at a company for 2 years is simply unacceptable in today‚Äôs job market.

If you‚Äôre open to considering another visa alternative, look at O-1.

It‚Äôs a lot of work to build a profile that will give you a shot at O-1 but it can be a great way to bypass the H-1B lottery, that is if your employer is open to supporting your application.

Ask your current employer as soon as you can if you can pursue O-1 with you bearing the full costs of the application.

If your company lawyer stops you, escalate your case to someone senior at your company.

Will talk more about this topic in the Discord community.

Post Date: EB-2 NIW is backed up by policy guidance that very clearly applies to immigrants in STEM right now.

If you look at memos issued by the Biden administration and USCIS‚Äô Policy Manual, you‚Äôll see explicit mention of the need for immigrants to help advance specific areas of national interest.

You‚Äôll see, for example, mentions of healthcare, renewable energy, and a bunch of other fields, and how immigrants with specific skills in these fields are key to advancing these fields of national interest.

It‚Äôs why I stress the proposed endeavor when it comes to NIW as evidently, USCIS cares about whether you intend to and are well qualified to advance an area of national interest.

That‚Äôs the bar, and given the current state of the law, it‚Äôs reachable for a lot of STEM master‚Äôs graduates as well as current PhD students.

Post Date: There is a possibility that layoffs will be the norm for the next few years.

If layoffs become a quarterly or even annual occurrence at major companies, PERM will be heavily impacted and we may arrive at a point where immigrants can no longer rely on PERM to secure their priority dates.

This is especially relevant for those of you who are master‚Äôs students and are a year from graduation.

Given where things are headed, PERM is unlikely to continue as the once smooth and straightforward path that it once was to a green card (remember those 6 month wait-times? They‚Äôre now up to 2 years).

So if you want employment and immigration freedom, start preparing now for NIW or even EB-1A if you qualify.

For example, and this is a common profile, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve just finished up a master‚Äôs in electrical engineering in the U.S.

Right off the bat, you already have a promising profile.

Promising, but by no means complete or strong.

No matter how prestigious your alma mater, strong cases still show at least one or a mix of the following:

‚Ä¢ Professional involvement in your field e.g membership and leadership positions in professional associations related to your field of proposed endeavor.
‚Ä¢ Recognized contributions to your field of proposed endeavor.
‚Ä¢ Demonstrating that you have a proposed endeavor in mind that aligns with a field of national interest.

Doing all of the above well takes a lot of thought and care so be prepared to devote a lot of time and effort to building a profile and shaping your proposed endeavor.

I was asked the other day by one of our Discord community members about whether speaking engagements at tech conferences matter for NIW.

I tend to discuss speaking engagements at conferences and other events under leading/critical role, original contributions, and occasionally under other parts of the EB-1 criteria. And I also highlight these often under Prong 2 of the NIW framework.

These opportunities also help in USCIS‚Äô final analysis of the case and are definitely considered proof of recognition and contribution to the field/industry.

Agriculture is definitely an area of national importance but a field for which I haven‚Äôt seen too many NIW applicants, but think there should be a lot more.

In the field of data privacy, I‚Äôve seen a lot more applicants come through in recent years. Given its growing importance, I expect more professionals in this field to start looking at NIW.

Haven‚Äôt seen too many biostatistics applicants, but I am getting more of them, and the few I have spoken to had no idea they qualified for NIW (even though these are such excellent cases!).

Robotics is another great field for NIW and is a field of growing national interest.

Psychology and mental health were not always considered as fields of national importance until recently when they were mentioned in USCIS‚Äô priorities memo. I think applicants in these fields might actually have a good chance for the rest of 2024.

Any other interesting fields that you‚Äôve come across in which you‚Äôve been seeing growing interest in NIW or whose professionals you think might be a good fit?

Post Date: Never call USCIS for legal advice.

You‚Äôll just get a call center employee who‚Äôs been specifically told to not answer questions that involve legal advice. Or who has a script and doesn‚Äôt know how to use it. Or is genuinely trying to be nice and helpful but doesn‚Äôt have any of the background knowledge needed to answer questions.

Yes, USCIS itself doesn‚Äôt know enough about the very laws that it‚Äôs supposed to administer to answer your legal questions.

USCIS has given advice that got people deported, left them without status, made them miss important deadlines, and actually ruined lives. They are not accountable for any of this. 

Always consult an immigration lawyer for legal advice - someone whose job is to represent your best interests (and who hopefully knows what they are doing) Not a USCIS call center employee.

Post Date: Got this question about providing exceptional ability for NIW requirements on our Discord the other day.

Some of you may think that you need to have both a master‚Äôs degree and exceptional ability to qualify.

That‚Äôs not true.

You do not need exceptional ability to be considered for NIW - a master‚Äôs alone is enough to meet the minimum requirement.

That being said, a master‚Äôs alone will not be enough to get the NIW approved - you‚Äôll also need to show broader impact on your field/industry and also show that your proposed NIW endeavor relates to a field of national interest.

Post Date: Getting your employer to sponsor your EB-2 NIW application can make sense for some of you.

Just remember that an employer-sponsored EB-2 NIW is not the same as an EB-2 NIW that you file on your own.

The reason is that the I-140 you get through an EB-2 NIW approval will not be in your name, which means for it to be valid and usable by the time you file an adjustment application, you‚Äôll most likely need to still be working for the employer that sponsored your EB-2 NIW application.

Post Date: I‚Äôve had a lot of clients ask if they‚Äôre a part of a flood of applications for EB-1A.

I get why someone might think there‚Äôs a flood of applications since everyone seems to be talking about EB-1A.

It looks like EB-1As in FY2022 were around 10,000 received, then in FY2023 around 15,000 received, and now in FY2024 on track for 18,000 to be received. 

But the data also doesn‚Äôt show a flood of decisions from USCIS over this time period, approvals or denials, just a small uptick. It‚Äôs about an 8% increase in USCIS decisions, when looking at year over year data for the last 10 years. Is the discrepancy between filings and decisions because people are withdrawing their applications? Or a huge administrative backlog?

USCIS data is not the easiest to parse and read. The agency doesn‚Äôt publish its data in a way that is easy to determine actual filing, approval, and denial rates. 

But here is what we can tell so far.

A senior architect with a lot of experience in building AI tools used by major companies.

I actually expected an RFE for this case given that the scope of work was primarily benefiting the person‚Äôs employer and not necessarily the larger industry (though we did show impact to the larger industry), but we did not end up getting any RFE.

Based on what we‚Äôre seeing, it looks like USCIS is still approving a lot of AI based EB-2 NIW cases.

Post Date: This is interesting and exciting new guidance from USCIS on EB1As!

First thoughts - -

The guidance makes things much easier for professors, scholars, researchers, and generally anyone with a Ph.D. (especially STEM). There are lots of common sense clarifications that directly negate a lot of template language being thrown around in current RFEs. 

But the guidance is all geared towards these kinds of petitions. There is still an abysmal lack of guidance for petitions in the field of Business, and very little for Artists and Athletes. All of these other petition types can still be approved and are actually contemplated as equal to Science in the language of the statute and regulations. Hopefully USCIS will continue to develop its guidance so the adjudications in these other fields will be less arbitrary in the future. 

(It's really arbitrary right now). 

Contact me if you want a reassessment of your case in light of the updated guidance!

Post Date: When I was a corporate immigration attorney, PERM would drive me (and my clients) crazy. 

Everyone thought that having a master's degree or special skills would help their immigration situation. Managers and employees would tell me "but we need to sponsor this person because they do super specialized work on the team". That doesn't actually matter much in the PERM process at big companies. PERM cases are pretty bland and generic. And the programs are designed that way for legal compliance reasons (and enforced with investigations and lawsuits from the DOL). 

I now enjoy working with individuals on shaping highly personalized cases for self-sponsorship. It's much more creative and fulfilling, and I get to learn so many interesting things!

The key takeaway for me is that even though the vast majority of employers agree that it is now harder to hire foreign employees in the U.S., they also believe it is incredibly important to their business and show no signs of slowing down when recruiting and retaining these employees. Instead, employers are looking at strategies to improve their immigration programs in this challenging time.

Post Date: I‚Äôve talked to a couple of people who are maxing out on H-1B next month.

Many want to file EB-2 NIW immediately, but a month simply is not enough time to put together a case with attorney support.

If you are about to max out and still have a few months or even half a year left of H-1B, it‚Äôs best to make a plan to leave the U.S. a few weeks before your maxout date, apply for EB-2 NIW abroad, and if you get approved then have your employer file the H-1B extension as a consular case requesting a full 3 years of H-1B time and apply for a visa stamp at the consulate in your country to allow you to go back on H-1B.

Leaving with a few weeks left of H-1B also helps you avoid any potential issues with incorrect H-1B calculations that you may have gotten from your company lawyers.

Yes, this is a very real issue and I‚Äôve seen situations where incorrect H-1B maxout calculations resulted in overstays, unauthorized work, and denied requests to recapture and extend H-1B based on an approved I-140.

If you want my template for max-out calculations, just message me! You can verify this for yourself.

Post Date: O-1 is not straightforward.

It‚Äôs why a lot of company lawyers do not like to take on O-1s.

If you‚Äôre seriously considering O-1, you should either go the founder route or if you‚Äôre already employed by a company, convince your employer to let you navigate the whole process and bear the full cost of the application.

You may also need to show ample evidence to your employer that you‚Äôve built your profile up to a certain point where you‚Äôre likely to meet the O-1 criteria and not get denied.

Sometimes, this bar is set by your company‚Äôs lawyer and may be much higher than what‚Äôs actually needed to get an O-1 visa.

Yes, makes no sense again - your visa options really should be your business and your business alone (IMO) - but because of what happened with the past administration, companies and their lawyers are now more wary than ever of O-1 employee applicants because they don‚Äôt want to deal with another spike in case denial rates.

Post Date: NIW can be difficult for nurses.

This is what I told my client, a nurse from Brazil.

It‚Äôs true - USCIS does not tend to approve NIWs for nurses, because the agency defaults to thinking of them as being eligible for Schedule A cases instead, so we had to think about what we could do to strengthen my client‚Äôs case.

I was actually her second lawyer - another firm had initially handled her case. They didn‚Äôt do anything bad, but once my client received an RFE, she no longer felt like the firm believed in her case.

To her, they had given up, so she took her immigration future into her own hands and started looking for second opinions (which is how we met).

In response to her RFE, we focused on my client‚Äôs national impact in Brazil as a nurse over the past decade and on how she could help with the nurse shortage problem that the U.S. was dealing with at the time during the pandemic. 

Concurrently, my client also received an RFE in regards to her green card application. In response to that RFE, we showed that my client had certifications that were the equivalent to those of a U.S. trained nurse, even without an official third-party certification. 

Her NIW was granted and my client now works in the U.S. as a nurse.

Especially for something as important as a petition that might help secure your future in this country.

This also applies to those of you who have a lawyer already (either one you hired or through your employer).

For many clients, I‚Äôve reviewed legal petitions that had to be completely rewritten to help strengthen my client‚Äôs case.

Who knows what would have happened had they just moved forward and submitted whatever their employer‚Äôs lawyer had prepared.

Not saying that every case I get for a second opinion requires a full redo - sometimes, I review excellent work and am able to affirm what has been submitted (I like when that happens).

A second opinion never hurts, especially if you‚Äôve only got one shot at making a case for yourself.

Post Date: Most immigration tech available to U.S. lawyers is focused on collecting and managing data through workflows. The foundation is the questionnaire, which the client fills out, and the data from that questionnaire is then filtered into the relevant form fields and used to prepare the case. There are others parts to the database that the lawyer fills in that are likewise then filtered into the forms and can be maintained with changes. 

This kind of tech cuts down on the time needed to prepare a case, but it's not the solution I am envisioning for the future.

The first problem that has not yet been solved is that clients hate to do their own data entry. And who can blame them? When they travel, the airport has these really nice kiosks that allow them to scan their passports and the data is all populated automatically. If this is what clients see when they travel, they definitely expect it in other formats. If a client is providing the lawyer with a document, why do they need to also type the information from that document into a questionnaire? 

Automatic reading and extraction of data from passports, I94s, I797s, etc. is a tech capability that needs to be further developed until it is part of every tech solution. I think clients are reasonably annoyed that it doesn't exist yet in most cases.

I think more interestingly though, once document reading and data extraction is more widely available, lawyers can do all kinds of further things with it. I envision a future where I don't really ever need to review PERM ad proofs, because the computer can do it for me with greater accuracy. I envision a future where I don't need to ensure every document is in the file everytime, because the computer can read the documents, identify key data, and tell me it is good to go.

Having these features built out will allow me to focus on legal strategy, while filing cases faster and with better guaranteed accuracy.

What tech features do you think are most important for the future? What are you looking forward to in the future?

Hard work, but can be done if you start early enough and make the right moves.

Is something I get a lot in consultations.

If possible, at least try to have whomever you‚Äôre helping with a legal issue be present in interactions with an attorney you intend to hire.

I get it - sometimes it‚Äôs not possible but if it is, make sure they‚Äôre involved in all legal conversations about their case.

The last thing you want to do is communicate the wrong information to a lawyer, which results in the lawyer telling you the wrong information that you pass on to that person.

Nevermind the ethical issues. I‚Äôm super uncomfortable commenting on someone else‚Äôs case without having them present. 

Don‚Äôt impersonate people either. Believe it or not, I‚Äôve had that happen, where someone presents facts as their own when they really belong to a relative. 

Tell your lawyer the truth. And if you are helping a friend or relative, get them a meeting with the lawyer and be helpful, but let them tell the truth in first person.

He was on OPT (non-stem) and only had one shot at the lottery. When he found out he had not been selected, he decided to look for another way to stay in the U.S. and decided to pursue an O-1 visa.

When he spoke to his company‚Äôs immigration counsel, he was told that he had a slim chance of qualifying and that they wouldn‚Äôt be filing for an O-1 visa for him on his behalf.

He looked for a second opinion (as you should) and that‚Äôs how we ended up working together.

When I first took a look at his case, I felt like it had potential. It wasn‚Äôt an extremely strong case but my client did have a few publications and a few citations. It was also clear that he was in the top 10% of his field and had extremely strong references, so I gave his case a shot.

We put together a strong case - we had detailed reference letters, well-researched claims, supplementary evidence, and work-product to showcase his ability. We also opted for premium processing to speed things up.

In a matter of weeks, the case got approved.

No RFE.

Post Date: Just had an interesting consultation with someone who‚Äôs at the forefront of Generative AI.

She doesn‚Äôt have any major publications but is working on several exciting projects, which more than demonstrate that she is at the forefront of a relatively nascent but fast-growing industry.

She‚Äôs also worked at several well known companies, has a few published articles (but not too many citations yet, although she expects this to change in the near future once the literature on Generative AI starts to grow), is involved in several third-party organizations, and won a few awards.

With such a new field like Generative AI, you do have to consider the strength of your profile for NIW or EB-1A and whether you right now can demonstrate extraordinary ability or national impact.

For many professionals, even for those who aren‚Äôt published or don‚Äôt have a high number of citations, you can still qualify and should still consider NIW or EB-1A as valid green card paths, especially given USCIS‚Äô prioritization of AI-related employment-based visas in recent months. 

Yes, now is a great time to apply but only if you have a strong profile in the field of Generative AI. If you don‚Äôt, you can still take your chances but perhaps waiting until you develop a stronger profile might be the better move.

Post Date: Yesterday I was admitted to practice before the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. I can now bring lawsuits for clients who have been treated unfairly or subjected to extreme delays at USCIS. 

This is a super exciting step in my career! I started out at law school knowing that I wanted to litigate cases against the government. I did an official concentration in litigation and dispute resolution at Boston University School of Law, and when I got my first job out of law school, I thought I had to choose between Immigration Law (my first passion) and Litigation (my second choice). But over the last 5 years of practice, I have been inspired by so many in our profession who are doing both. Being able to file lawsuits is a major driver in why I started my own practice. 

And the government is always wrong anyway, #amiright? Sue them when they‚Äôre wrong.

She was at her six year maximum on her H-1B and wanted to stay in the U.S. Her employer had messed the timing of her PERM application, so NIW was the only clear path for her to stay.

It was a strong but untraditional case in the field of new medicine.

While she had no publications, she showed clear evidence that she was a leader in the field, had taken on and shown leadership qualities in several leadership roles, could show service to her field through her patient advocacy work as well as national impact through her efforts to ensure that new medicine was going to U.S. patients in need.

Post Date: I'm seeing lots of news of layoffs on my LinkedIn feed. Layoffs have unique implications and corresponding anxiety for immigrant employees.

Good employers will seek to support the employee through the layoff process, including giving access to the company's immigration attorney for consultation and advice on grace periods. But all employees should be aware that any advice coming from the company at this stage is given in a way that will protect the company's interests, every time. Employees should get individual counsel during layoffs unless they already have sponsorship secured with a new employer. 

From my professional experience, it is really hard when employees in L1 status are laid off. Sometimes there are some options, but these employees have it tough.

But H1B and F1 OPT employees usually have a good chance of being able to stay if they secure a new job offer pretty quickly. 

Some people can even submit their I140/I485 during the grace period, especially if they qualify for self-sponsorship through the Extraordinary Ability EB1A or the National Interest Waiver EB2.

Post Date: USCIS issued an RFE just last week for an EB-1A based green card application, asking for my clients to prove their 20+ year marriage is real. 

These RFEs pop up as a trend now and then. I can't understand why. USCIS really isn't supposed to question the marriage unless it's less than 2 years old or unless there is some kind of indicator of fraud. After 20 years, it's a bit ridiculous to question this. 

But then, they had to apply for Emergency Advance Parole because USCIS didn't approve their normal Advance Parole application with the EAD card (causing panic because there are real family emergencies and some people can't wait 6+ months to travel). 

And the officer at the Infopass appointment tells them that they should really file that RFE response as soon as possible because it is "blocking" the green card process from being completed. 

Thanks USCIS. Thanks.

Post Date: There is no greater feeling of accomplishment than winning a really hard case! 

It's the reason being a lawyer is satisfying despite the long hours, great uncertainty, and unreasonable rules and systems that we have to deal with.

Being a lawyer is awesome.

Post Date: The 60 day grace period is discretionary.

And not well defined with a formula.

So several different dates can often be used to calculate start and end dates of the 60 day period.

USCIS has yet to release clear guidance on how to calculate when your grace period starts and ends.

The most conservative start date is your last day of real paid work.

A commonly claimed and accepted start date is the last day a normal salary disbursement was paid.

A riskier interpretation is the last day of the last paycheck.

And then of course there are all kinds of creative alternatives and ways to register leave or severance that can come into play.

The consequences of using the wrong dates to calculate your 60 day grace period are not commonly severe as long as you are reasonable and show USCIS why you calculated from a certain date.

But USCIS has the final say, so you can‚Äôt know for sure.

Also your attorney can‚Äôt say for sure. This is important. We can advise you on potential risks and benefits but we can‚Äôt give you guarantees of what USCIS will do.

Post Date: I am often surprised at how many people I talk to who are worried that they cannot take time off from work without jeopardizing their H-1B status. 

I even had a client who was pregnant one time who thought she was not able to take the standard 12 weeks maternity leave! I could not wait to reassure her and encourage her to take that full amount, if not more.

H-1B workers are entitled to the same options as any other U.S. worker. Occasionally there might be some complex scenarios or questions that should be discussed with a lawyer, but in general, normal leave and breaks are permissible even if they end up being classified as unpaid leave.

Post Date: Well, the U.S. government is saying there is a 5 and a half year backlog for India EB-1 (the people at the very top of their fields). 

Meanwhile all the rest of the work-sponsored employees from India are still stuck in an 11 year (which is maybe actually 50-90+ years) backlog.

Unexpected. And very discouraging. 

Is there any good pathway for Indian nationals to immigrate to America? I'll be posting more analysis later, since this just got released.

Post Date: I received an EB-1A approval yesterday that made my day. 

This client had come to me after some strategy disagreements with their employer‚Äôs attorney. They had given my client some advice that I felt was biased in the company‚Äôs favor. My client wanted a second opinion. 

We decided to go ahead and pursue an EB-1A extraordinary ability petition where my client petitioned for themselves, not tied to the employer. 

This case was approved in 10 days with no RFE! Now my client can pursue their permanent residency without being tied to a specific company or subject to its policies and timelines. My client will greatly benefit the United States while enjoying the freedom they deserve. 

Everyone deserves to know their options from an unbiased viewpoint, not tied to the employer or employer‚Äôs attorney.

Post Date: Not very many people qualify under the memberships criterion, but it is powerful when they do. Memberships are also one of those things that aspiring EB-1A applicants can plan for and control. Professional organizations are often looking for experts who are interested in lending their talent and expertise professionally in service of the group. They are willing to extend invitations to people who express interest, as long as the qualifications remain sound. 

If you are thinking about EB-1A for the future, investing in memberships takes work and effort, but is well worthwhile. 

Comment below if you have any favorite organizations or questions about what might qualify!

Post Date: Celebrating tonight over another NIW approval!

My client contacted me in June because something had gone very wrong in his green card process with his current company. He had a prior EB-2 approval more than 12 years ago and was from India, so getting his green card filed ASAP was a top priority.

Unfortunately, like almost every employee does, he had changed jobs in the last 12 years, and his new employer needed to go through the PERM process before he could file for his green card, despite the fact that he had already waited for it for so long. But even after having the new PERM process drag on for a year due to long processing times, the PERM was denied. 

After the denial, he faced not only another year, but probably a year and a half longer to try again with a new PERM because processing times have lengthened so much more over the last few months. 

We decided to file an NIW. He did not have a typical occupation or profile for an NIW - a master's degree instead of a Ph.D., and no publications or media participation. But he was very clearly working in an area critical to U.S. interests at an advanced stage in his career, doing some very cool things. Despite not having a "typical" profile, I think his situation is at the heart of the purpose of the NIW law.

Given that it isn't a typical profile, an RFE or other delays were not unexpected. But I was so happy to receive the approval this evening, without any RFE, less than 6 months after filing the NIW petition. 

Now my client can finally get his green card. More importantly, he has options and greater freedom, and no more anxiety over this crazy immigration process.

Post Date: It's been nearly 3 months now since I launched Waypoint Immigration USA, and as consultations roll in and I get more into social media marketing, I am falling more and more in love with my website. I hired Say Yes Business Solutions on the recommendation of a colleague, and they built an amazingly functional website for me that I actually like looking at.

I can do everything so easily, from automatic  appointment bookings, invoicing and payments, social media post creation and scheduling, blog posting, etc. And the cost of doing these things is so much lower than I thought! Especially the credit card fees. What I have set up here is much lower than the companies that market directly to lawyers.

Say Yes didn't ask me for this review, but I wanted to share with my network because I have been so happy with the results.

Post Date: It's the season for new law grads to start applying for their first associate jobs. And all the resumes are a mess because everything has its own category. like "Honor", "Award", "Activity", "Competition". etc. It's irrelevant, untopical lists as far as the eye can see.

It's also the time where I am reminded daily of the school careers office strict rules and my first introduction to the lawyer profession's insane obsession with minute and irrelevant details. 

Like what can be listed as an "honor" or not. Like how would would automatically ruin your reputation and be AN UNETHICAL LAWYER if you did not clearly distinguish between honors and other activities on your resume. 

This didn't really ever make sense to me, because all my activities in law school were important, and the "honors" were actually less important to most of my job searching than the other activities I participated in. 

After my first year of being a lawyer, I ignored the "rule" and listed a clean bullet point list of "Honors and Activities". It felt like a betrayal of the profession, but it made so much common sense and was totally reasonable. And no one called me unethical!

Lawyers are pretty crazy and unreasonable a lot of the time. And we tie this crazy unreasonableness to norms and standards for the profession. To ethics. 

I think this makes us afraid to do perfectly normal and reasonable things sometimes. 

Just wondering if this particular aspect of entering the profession was as confusing and profoundly impactful as it was to me. I feel sometimes that I am still "recovering" from this truly startling learning experience, years later.

Post Date: People seem to be talking about USCIS raising EB-2 NIW standards.

Makes sense given how many people are now looking into and applying for EB-2 NIW.

Based on what I‚Äôm seeing, USCIS does not seem to be raising standards but that does not mean you qualify simply because you have a master‚Äôs degree or a bachelor‚Äôs degree plus five years of experience.

To file a strong case, you‚Äôll still need a strong proposed endeavor and show how you are well positioned to make an individual impact in the U.S.

Post Date: A lot of people who self-file their EB-2 NIW tend to:

- Not submit the $300 asylum fee.
- Not check the box to let USCIS know that they employ fewer than 25 employees.

Both of these requirements seem unrelated and not at all obvious for a proper EB-2 NIW filing, but they are in fact requirements.

It‚Äôs just that only a lawyer would know that they‚Äôre requirements because they‚Äôre only mentioned in USCIS‚Äô FAQs, which were only issued in response to a rule change, something only attorneys seem to look at.

So if you are planning on self-filing, make sure you submit the asylum fee and check the box that tells USCIS that you do not employ more than 25 employees.

I know a lot of you are struggling with the new work arrangements and transition, but I want you to know it‚Äôs not like this in the normal world. Even though introverts like me love to concentrate on the work from our home offices, we also love the coffeeshops, shared workspaces, networking events, and seeing people smile every day.

This past month I‚Äôve discovered video calls are a huge help. Keep smiling and seeking those connections. It works.

Post Date: As I shared in a recent post, to help those of you who are interested in taking control of your own immigration future, I‚Äôve decided to host a paid livestream to answer your questions.

I aim to make this a weekly livestream. Pricing is $20 per month for maximum accessibility. The first livestream will be tomorrow (12/14) at 11:30 AM EST.

Again, this is not a course nor is it some sort of magic bullet - it is a forum where you can ask me questions about O-1, NIW, or EB-1, and can learn from others' questions and answers to them. I will also cover profile-building.

While the answers I give to questions won‚Äôt be legal advice (don‚Äôt think the general statements apply to you specifically without asking an attorney for individualized advice), the answers will still point you in the right direction based on my years of experience handling thousands of cases and advocating for all kinds of individuals.

Post Date: Yes, you can get NIW without publications (or other ‚Äútraditional‚Äù NIW profile markers) as it‚Äôs all a balancing test to USCIS.

To USCIS, it‚Äôs always the same question:

Would it be in the national interest to waive this applicant‚Äôs labor certification requirement?

You as an applicant need to show strong evidence in the affirmative, which is far more than just showing that you have the qualities traditionally associated with a strong NIW profile.

- Publications.
- Membership to professional associations.
- Research.

They matter, but only if they strengthen your overall profile and help answer the above question.

For example, having done research that only impacts your company and only minimally impacts the broader field may not be as helpful as having authored cited publications that have made a lasting impact on your field.

Your profile also needs to make sense as a whole - every piece needs to line up together to show that your work and your proposed endeavor is in the national interest.

Post Date: I did a consultation with someone last week who did not get selected for H-1B.

We talked about O-1 as an option but it looks like they don‚Äôt have a profile for O-1.

We also talked about cap exempt H-1Bs, which can be a great option but is not as simple as you think.

There are a lot of exceptions when it comes to applying for a cap exempt H-1B through a nonprofit (for example, not all nonprofits can file a cap exempt H-1B for you) so you‚Äôll want to speak with a lawyer who has experience in this area.

Post Date: Planning for the H-1B lottery starts early! If this is your first job post-grad and your first time through the process, make sure you have the sponsorship conversation with your employer ASAP. 

I have seen too many situations where an employer waits until the very last second in March to make a decision on whether or not they are sponsoring their employee, and then at the last moment decides not to. The employee loses a chance in the lottery. This can change your entire life. Don't let the important conversation wait that long. 

I have also seen too many situations where the employee (in their very first job ever) accepts an employer's plan to sponsor them "next year" and loses a chance. Don't let your employer pull this one over on you. If your employer is not going to sponsor you, find a new job while the job market is still hot.
