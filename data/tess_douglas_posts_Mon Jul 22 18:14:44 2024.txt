Post Date: DACA is now illegal.

But what does this really mean?

- No new DACA applications can be approved
- Current DACA recipients can still get DACA
- Pending (new) DACA applications remain pending 
- USCIS can still accept (but not approve) new apps

---

Yesterday a district court judge ruled that Obama's DACA program and the updates made to it by Biden are illegal.

The court concluded that the programs go against Congressional intent, so the Executive branch (the President) can't make these changes without Congress.

The decision will go to the 5th Circuit appeals court. And then potentially the Supreme Court.

This isn't final.

But I predict the outcome may be similar as it goes up the courts.

Post Date: üßº Want a clean criminal record for immigration? üßº

DO NOT do this... 

Get an expungement.

Why not?

Nearly all expungements have NO impact on your immigration case.

Your crime will still be "on your record" for your immigration case.

If your conviction is expunged because you completed probation, time has passed, and/or you showed that you've rehabilitated, it often means nothing for immigration.

Maybe you want an expungement for other reasons (like job applications/background checks).  So it might be worth doing.  But just be aware that it probably wont help with your immigration case.

So what can you do?

‚úîÔ∏è Check with a immigration attorney to see if your crime will impact your immigration status

‚úîÔ∏è Work with a criminal attorney to see if you can get the charge/conviction/sentence changed so that it will not impact you immigration status

Usually I am pro "do-it yourself" immigration (with the right guidance/tools), but this is one area where you should NOT go it alone.

You could spend a lot of time and money and end up exactly where you started.

Post Date: If you filed premium processing...

What does this case status mean?

It usually means an RFE.

The case status doesn't say "we've sent you a request for evidence."

Instead, it says that the premium processing clock is stopped.

Neither you nor your attorney will receive an email/electronic copy of the RFE.

Indeed, we just received an RFE faxed to us.

...thank goodness we still have a fax number.

Even though premium processing has some nice email update features, this does not include getting the RFE.

You have to wait for fax or snail mail for your lovely RFE.

Post Date: 5 tips for every immigration interview.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Dress to impress, but be comfortable. 

Think slacks/chinos and a button/sweater down for guys, and a skirt/dress pants and blouse/sweater for gals. Jeans are OK, but avoid jeans with holes.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Arrive early.  

But know that USCIS probably won't let you in the building until 15min before your appointment.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Be ready to WAIT. 

Even once you get into the building, you might have to wait several hours before your interview begins.  Just because you have an appointment time, does not mean the interview will begin at the scheduled time.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Be aware that USCIS does NOT call the interview numbers in order.

If you are number "P79" you might get called after "P96" or vice versa. Try not to stress if you hear a much higher number than yours called before you.  This is normal.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Sit close to the doors where officers are coming out.  

This way you can easily hear them call the numbers.  Some officers whisper the numbers (I don't know why), so you want to be close by to hear your number called.

Finally...

Breath, you got this. üí®üëçÔ∏è

Here are 6 simple steps.

..taken from our NIW webinar today.

1) Define your field (what are you the expert in?)
2) Join a national professional organization 
3) Volunteer to judge a competition 
4) Help organize a professional conference
5) Create useful content on social media
6) Start tracking your metrics

Post Date: How long will my immigration case take?

You probably want a concrete answer to this.

And that is fair. You need to plan your life.

But...

The range can be wild.

For example, for a simple green card renewal (I-90), the case can take...

Anywhere from 1 to 20 months!

I just had 2 green card renewals approved.

One took 20+ months.

The other was approved in less than a month!

If anything the 1-month approval had more "issues."

This is why it's so hard to give a helpful prediction to clients.

I always wish I could give a more concrete answer.

But it's so hard to predict!

...even if you look at the USCIS case processing times.

P.S. Just in case you were still wondering, USCIS does not use the FIFO method.

Biometrics appointment rescheduling.

In the past, we used to have to try to call the USCIS customer service line...

Shouting into the phone BIOMETRICS RESCHEDULE, hoping to get a human being on the phone.

Now, I can login to my USCIS account, and request to reschedule the appointment for a client with just the receipt number (I don't even need to have that client linked to my online account, thank goodness, because many of my filings don't get linked by USCIS).

This client had prior travel plans.

And in minutes I was able to reschedule the appointment to a day she would be in town.

USCIS issued a new appointment notice almost instantaneously.

Hurray!

I hope USCIS can model other online services after this one.

Post Date: A client once emailed me 6 times before 7:30am. 

I was so annoyed. 

But now I get it.

If you are going through the U.S. immigration system, you probably feel out of control.

Your employer has control.
USCIS has control.
The consulate has control.
COVID has control.
The visa bulletin has control.

But you don't have control.

So what's a way to try to take control?

Check-in on your case. Ask what's going on. Email your lawyer.

Sometimes it's the only thing you can do.

It's easy for me to forget this and just get annoyed.  

But I have to check myself.

---

The key takeaway here is NOT to email me 6 times a day. Please don't.

But instead, to say...I get it. 

And I have to admit, I would be a high-maintenance client myself. 

I love to anxiously try to take control of things I have no control over.

‚ùåMr. Smith has made significant original contributions to the field.

‚úÖ Before Mr. Smith's unique machine learning algorithm revealed the risks of using protein purification in XYZ vaccine, no one in the field had ever evaluated the risks using this machine learning method. Now pharmaceutical companies are mimicking this practice for multiple vaccines.

Remember...

Anyone can restate the law. 
Anyone can say you are extraordinary
Anyone can say that what you do is in the national interest.

The butt rule of immigration law.

You read that right.
 
üçë The butt rule üçë 
 
This rule will tell you what kind of work you can and cannot do in the US.
 
Can I sell stuff on Etsy while on my H-1B?
Can I be an independent contractor?
Can I work remotely in the US?
Can I work remotely outside the US?
 
The answer to these questions‚Ä¶
 
üçë The butt rule üçë 
 
If your butt is in the US while you doing the work, you need a work permit.
 
If you have an H-1B (O-1, L-1, etc.), your status is tied to that specific job.
 
So, any additional work you do while your butt is in the US is not allowed (aka "unauthorized employment").
 
If your butt is outside the US, you don't need any US work permit to do the work. Even if you work for a US-based company.
 
So to prevent your butt from becoming unauthorized, make sure you use the butt rule.
 
Ok that's all. I already said butt too many times for LinkedIn.

Post Date: 3 EB-1A criteria that will lead to a loser case.

If you ONLY have these 3 criteria, your case will be hard to win.

What 3?

1. High salary
2. Significant original contributions
3. Leading/critical role at a distinguished organization

Those sound impressive.

What's wrong with them?

If these are your 3, then you probably have made a major impact on your company.

But USCIS will wonder how you are impacting your field outside of your company.

If your work was so original and significant to the field, then why aren't you getting media recognition, judging invitations, or receiving awards?

Where is the objective evidence of your impact?

I am sure someone has won an EB-1A with just these 3.

But if you want to make your life easier, not harder, then seek out some other criteria too.

Don't leave USCIS wondering.

Because you know what that means...

RFEs, NOIDs, denials.

No one wants that.

4. School scholarships

There are always exceptions.

If your Youtube interview has millions of views that is different.

But I've even seen USCIS push back on that.

USCIS is old-fashioned.

They look to see old-fashioned evidence.

---

If you've done these "bad" things, they won't hurt you.

Because it can get your name out there in the field.

But think of this evidence as a stepping stone.

Not as the primary evidence in your case.

Submitting this kind of evidence will do more harm than good for an EB-1A case.

But doing this work can help get your name out there.

Because you put yourself in a position for other recognition.

Other recognition that will lead to GOOD evidence.

So maybe it's not all BAD.

Post Date: Avoid this degree if you want an H-1B.

Business Administration.

Why?

To get an H-1B you have to show that your job is a "specialty occupation."

What does that mean?

That the job requires a specific degree.

For example, if you are a software engineer and you have a software engineering or computer science degree.

Or you're an architect and have an architect degree.

You want your degree to be as matchy-matchy as possible to the job.

And your degree also needs to be SPECIFIC.

Business Administration is not specific.

Time and time again, US immigration has said that a Business Administration degree is too general.

So if you're an F-1 student trying to decide your major, and you like business, maybe consider something else like accounting, finance, or economics.

Post Date: Work in the cybersecurity industry? 

Good news, sponsoring yourself for a green card just got easier.

A recent White House report explains how critical the cybersecurity industry is to the United States.

This report is PERFECT evidence for a National Interest Waiver green card petition.

It helps show 2 of the key requirements:

1) that your work is in the national interest

2) that it makes sense to waive the normal employer sponsor requirement

If you work on anything related to cybersecurity, you'll want to save this report for your NIW petition!

This report alone will not win you your NIW case, but it will certainly help.

Night before:
Set alarm early to get a brief done in the morning before my son wakes up.

5:30am: 
Alarm goes off, walk straight to my desk in PJs and start brief writing. 

5:45am: 
Son wakes up. Every other day he wakes up at 7:15. But not today.

6:00am:
He doesn't seem to be going back to sleep. My husband gets him out of bed & preps breakfast. 

7:15am: 
My husband leaves for the gym.

7:15-8am:
Read the tractor book at least 5 times. Attempt to dress a wiggly noodle child. Ask if he has to pee before we go. He says no.

8:15am: 
Drive to daycare. Hear "I have to go potty." Realize we forgot to put the green plastic potty in the car. Pull over, pull his pants down, wait for 15min in front of someone's nice lawn. He doesn't pee. Get back in the car.

8:35am:
Send a goofy good morning GIF to my team. Ready to take on the brief. Turn off phone notifications/distractions.  Except for the daycare app just in case anything happens.

8:50am: 
DAYCARE APP NOTIFICATION: "Hudson ate breakfast of yogurt and cookies." Cookies?! Rage about cookies for 15min. Text the other daycare moms.

9:15am: 
Back to brief writing. Print out a final draft. Edit with a red pen. Realize I forgot to sign up for swim lessons at 6:00am, so we will have to wait 3 more months for swim lessons. Feel guilty that I didn't get sunlight in my eyeballs or drink a liter of water first thing in the morning.

Post Date: Interview waiver.

Sounds like a good thing, right?

Not so fast.

If you are applying for a visa at a consulate, you might think it would be great if I don't have to go in person to an interview (don't have to take time off work, arrange travel, practice interview questions, etc.).

But, if you want your visa ASAP, an interview waiver can be a BAD thing.

It's taking some consulates MONTHS to process an interview waiver case and return your visa to you.

And this is even when the consulate's website shows interview slots available the next day.

So you probably thought you'd get your visa back within a few days.

But this is not the case.

We recently had an H4 case out of Honduras where the person was eligible for an interview waiver.

Actually, she was REQUIRED to go through the interview waiver process.

Even though the Honduran consulate website said that there were visa appointments available for the next day, she was not allowed to book it.

Instead, she received instructions to send her documents to the consulate in an interview waiver packet.

The instructions said that the interview waiver processing usually takes 12 weeks!!

So now she is stuck waiting three months for her visa.

Yikes.

Interview waivers sound like they should make the process faster.

But unfortunately, this is not always the case.

And every consulate is different and it's not always clear how long you will have to wait.

So you're stuck with an unpredictable wait time on when you can travel to the US on your visa.

Post Date: I had a consult last week that shocked me.

But it shouldn't have.

The potential client was a small business owner. He filed a green card application for an employee.

Here's what shocked me...

He filed it by himself.

He downloaded the I-140 and I-485 from the USCIS website, filled the forms out and filed them.

This wasn't an EB1 or NIW case.

This was for a typical employee. 

He needed to go through PERM.

I could not believe he would do such a thing. 

Without PERM. What was he thinking?!

But then I had to check myself.

How would he know this?

PERM is confusing/complex for most (all?) immigration lawyers. Why would a small business owner know about this?

If you are a small business, you might set up your business, pay your taxes, seek your business license, run payroll, all on your own.

Why not immigration too?

Sometimes DIY immigration is possible.

I love to tell potential clients when they can do things on their own. 

But sometimes it's not possible.

PERM is one of them.

So, after I wiped the shock off my face, I helped him strategize a non-DIY plan.

---

It's easy to forget/take for granted what we know as immigration lawyers.

This was a good reminder.

And it's good news!

USCIS just clarified the 60-day grace period "typically begins" on the last day of your paycheck.

Instead of the last day in the office (or virtual office).

This is great news!

Before this announcement, I told people that they should consider the grace period beginning on the day they were laid off.

I am thrilled to be wrong.

---

‚¨áÔ∏è Key takeaway ‚¨áÔ∏è

If you are laid off and you receive severance pay, you have a better argument now more time to find a job in the US.

#immigration #layoffs #techlayoffs #H1Blayoffs #USCIS

---

*Update to post*
Based on great feedback from Ian Love.

The USCIS announcement does not say the 60-day grace period begins at the last day of severance. 

Instead it says "last day for which a salary or wage is paid." 

So it doesn't automatically mean that your 60-day grace period begins on the last day of your severance.

But it could help you argue that the 60-day grace period can start when your severance ends. 

There's still always a risk that USCIS could disagree.

But now you have more ammunition.

Post Date: 5 questions to ask your employer if you are laid off while on a temporary work visa.
 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Is there any wiggle room to move back the layoff date?
 
If there is any chance the answer could be yes then it's worth asking. This could help delay when your grace period begins and give you extra time to figure out your next step.
 
2Ô∏è‚É£ If you receive severance pay will the paystub look any different than your normal paystub?
 
When you change employers and file a new immigration application we typically submit paystubs to show that you are still employed with the previous employer. So if your paystub looks the same then it may be easier to change employers during severance.
 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Does your employer have any contacts that might be willing to sponsor you for a visa?
 
One of my clients recently did this and was introduced to her next sponsor. If you work for a smaller employer or one that you have a strong relationship with then you may be able to get some introductions that will help with your next work visa sponsorship.
 
4Ô∏è‚É£ Do they foresee being able to hire you back in the future?
 
Some companies are laying people off but then quickly rehiring. Maybe your manager or HR person can't share this, but if they could this can help you plan your next move.
 
5Ô∏è‚É£ Can I get a complete copy of my previous immigration applications (including all supporting documents)?
 
It will be much easier for any future immigration filings if you have all your documents from any previous applications. With the fast 60-day grace period, the more you can help speed things up the better.

(and why sending your resume is not enough).
 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Define your field of expertise
 
USCIS wants to see that you are an expert in your field. But before you can show that you are an expert, you need to say WHAT you are an expert in. So think to yourself...What topic am I an expert in? What do people come to me for? Be specific. Software Engineering is WAY too broad, Machine Learning is also too broad. Narrow it, and then narrow it again.
 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Write a list of all the ways you have impacted the field outside of just your company.
 
The key to these "merit-based" green cards is that you have impacted your industry/field, not just your company/organization. So ask yourself...Are people doing things differently in the field because of my work? How/why did this happen?
 
---
 
Your resume will likely not cover these 2 questions. So sending over a resume is not enough. Otherwise, you'll likely spend the whole consult talking about these 2 topics. 
 
If you come prepared with these answers then your attorney can dive into the profile evaluation and provide practical tips on how to build your profile if it's not quite there yet.

Of course, it can also be useful to spend time with an attorney going through these 2 issues, but it will be more valuable if you've already given it some thought.

Post Date: Why isn't my attorney filing my immigration case online?

Is my attorney behind the times?

No.

Many of us would love to file cases online.

But the reality is that they take at least 2x as long to file online.

Let's take the H-1B lottery registration for example.

This is required to be online.

And I am grateful to USCIS for trying to accept more online filings (I do not want to discourage this!).

Each year for online registrations I bake in a few days for the USCIS system to work out technical glitches.

Because every year there are at least a few days of errors/glitches that prevent people from registering. 

This is the norm.

This year I waited 5 days, thinking it would be enough.

I scheduled a call with my corporate clients to share screens and register. 

I do this rather than share instructions on how to do it on their own because frequently an error message appears or an email doesn't go through and so we have to troubleshoot on the call together.

I did this with one of my H-1B clients this week.

We made it all the way to the end of the registration and things seemed to be going smoothly.

But when we got to the last step, to pay the $10 registration fee, the payment page closed down and the system wouldn't let us pay.

The case is now stuck in "submitting."

We've reached out to the H-1B technical support email. 

And now we wait.

Other attorneys are facing the same problem.

And they reported that USCIS's fix is to delete the whole registration and have the attorney and client complete it again.

I will say this again, I do not want to discourage USCIS from the efforts they are making to go online (save the trees please!)...

But when attorneys have to bake in hours of extra time to hobble through the system with busy CEOs of companies trying to register, it is tough.

The system is not ready for prime time. We have to beta test on our clients.

For now paper is much more predictable, less time, and better for our clients.

So...if your attorney doesn't file your case online that's probably why. Not because they love paper.

Post Date: 3 main requirements to sponsor yourself for a green card.

That's it. 3.

BUT

These 3 "simple" requirements are not so simple.

For a national interest waiver (NIW) green card, you must show:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Your work has substantial merit and national importance
2Ô∏è‚É£ You are in a position to advance the field
3Ô∏è‚É£ It's a good thing that the U.S. government will not require you to show that no U.S. worker is available for the job

1 and 3 usually aren't so tricky.   But 2 is a landmine.

You need METRICS to show how YOU can advance your field.  

Maybe you're a thought leader with millions of followers, maybe you developed software that everyone is using, maybe you made a scientific discovery that everyone is relying on.  

This is the kind of evidence U.S. immigration is looking for.

The short list of requirements often deceives people into thinking that they easily qualify for NIW.  But sadly it's harder than it looks.

‚úçüèª As an email sign off?

Yes.

I stole it from my favorite law school professor.  When I first read it at the bottom of an email to our class, I thought, how strange? But now I use it all the time.

When I use this sign off, it makes me think about whether the info in my email is actually helpful. Is it easy/pleasant to read? Will my client have less questions or more after reading it?

As an attorney, I am tempted to provide LOTS of warnings to my clients. But if I can't make the info easy to understand, or if the email is so long that no one will read it, is it helpful? Or is it just a move to cover my üçë?

So I use this sign off as a natural check-in, to ask myself, did this email really help? 

And, it is a lot more fun than "Best." 

I hope this helps,

Post Date: USCIS announced policy changes for EB-1.

What are they changes? Are they good or bad?

It's a mix.

The good:

‚úÖ Some awards at the very top institutions can qualify, even if only available to the people within that org. 

‚úÖ Being mentioned as part of a team in major media qualifies

‚úÖ Invitations to speak at conferences = strong evidence

‚úÖ Industry STEM trade show presentation = strong comparable evidence



The bad:

üî¥ PR = a bad thing/not good evidence ("seemingly objective content" that is paid for is not good evidence)

üî¥ Publications should be for "learned persons in the field" rather than the common reader

üî¥ Job title is important for critical/leading role (senior, principal, founder, etc.)

üî¥ More emphasis on being a leading author on a publication with a high index factor for the final merits determination


You can check out all the changes here in my very ugly document identifying the updates in red.

I know this sounds simple, but you'd be surprised at how many blurry or unclear photos people submit to immigration. Make sure the photo is easy to see. It doesn't even have to be in color, just clear.

üè∑Ô∏è Unlabeled photos

List the names of the people in the photo, the month and year it was taken, and where/what you were doing. Without labels, the photos mean nothing to the immigration officers. 

üìöÔ∏è Too many photos

The immigration officer does not have time to review 1000s of wedding photos or photos of you at every conference presentation in the world. Choose 5-10 max.

The EAD is for a pending green card applicant (c9 category).

We filed her marriage-based adjustment of status in March (during the pre-April 1 fee hike craze).

And just over a month later we received her EAD approval.

We are still waiting on receipt notices for other cases filed around the same time.

We also received an EAD renewal approval for an asylum applicant in about the same time.

Post Date: I heard that [healthcare, manufacturing, semiconductors] is in the national interest...

Should I change industries for a better shot at NIW?

No!

Here's why...

When you apply for NIW, you need to prove that you are in a position to push your field forward.

To show this, you need to have expertise/leadership in the field.

If you jump around industries, you may be good at several things, but to USCIS you aren't really an expert in any one particular field.

The more you can narrow your focus, the easier it is to show that you stand out.

For example, a software engineer with a narrow focus on AI for wearable exercise sensors is going to have a stronger case than a software engineer who does AI for fintech for 5 years and then changes to AI for a hospital after that.

So don't be tempted to jump around just because it sounds like an industry is in the national interest.

---

However...

This strong "No!" to jumping industries changes if you are an F1 student just starting your career.

If you are deciding what career to jump into as an F1, then sure, choose one that is critical to the US national interest.

But if you are a seasoned professional, you will do yourself more harm than good jumping industries.

Join a committee.

What does that mean?

Let me use myself as an example.

I am a dues-paying member of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

This is an industry organization for immigration attorneys.

A few years ago I decided to join a committee.

The Congressional Advocacy Committee.

On this committee, I meet with federal congressional offices to advocate for immigration reform.

I did not have to submit an application.

I volunteered myself.

And now I am the chair of the committee.

This kind of evidence would be great for an NIW petition.

Because I could easily say that my work is influencing US policy.

But I did not have to do much to get there.

Of course, I have to contribute to the committee (and I enjoy doing it).

But I didn't need to compete with a ton of people.

Or get nominated.

Or get elected.

Or show that I am the best in my field.

And I bet there's something like this in your industry too.

So...if you are looking for an NIW shortcut, use this one.

Join a committee!

...and the more you can link that committee's work to US policy, the better.

Should I be worried?

If you have this feeling, your impression is right.

USCIS does seem more open to approving NIW petitions right now. 

Some are calling it the "golden age" of NIW.

Good news is that there isn't a max number of NIWs that can be issued.

Bad news is that all the approvals will all go into the EB2 line of the visa bulletin. So you will see more of a backlog in the EB2 green card line.

Short Answer: Not really.

Why not?

The letters already have all the juicy details about your accomplishments...

Why can't you use them for EB-1A (or an O-1 renewal)?

Because you must show that you have "sustained acclaim" in your field.

What in the world does that mean?

It means that you have made an impact in your field over time and you CONTINUE TO make an impact in the field.

If you submit old letters with old dates, USCIS will look at them and say, hey you haven't show us how you continued to impact the field since your last O-1. So we don't want to approve your case.

But luckily, you don't have to throw those letters out.

You can minimally update them with your new accomplishments.

And maybe add in 2-3 more letters from experts who can talk about the recent amazing things you've done in the field.

So not all is lost. 

The O-1 letters are still a good place to start.

Post Date: ‚õîÔ∏è The number one FLAW in immigration support letters? ‚õîÔ∏è 

Simply repeating the legal requirements for the visa.

Let me give you an example.

Let's say you are applying for an EB1 Extraordinary Ability Green Card.  You'll need support letters from experts in your field to explain your extraordinary ability.

One of your experts writes a letter saying some really wonderful things about you like:

‚≠êÔ∏èYou are one of the small percentage of people who has risen to the very top of your field of endeavor.

‚≠êÔ∏èYou have sustained international acclaim in your field.

‚≠êÔ∏èYour achievements have been internationally recognized in your field of expertise.

‚ùå But guess what? These statements don't mean anything, because they are just quotes from the legal requirements for an EB1 green card.

Anyone can repeat the legal requirements in a letter.

What's harder (and better) is to explain:

‚úÖ WHY you are considered a leader in the field

‚úÖ HOW you achieved international acclaim

‚úÖ HOW you pushed the field forward 

‚úÖ WHY and HOW other experts rely on your work

Even if you have the best expert in the world supporting your case, it won't help much if you fall into this common expert letter trap.

Post Date: What goes fast in the world of U.S. immigration?

Usually nothing. But luckily there is at least one exception: When you sue the U.S. government to force them to take action on a long-pending case. 

This process is called a ‚Äúwrit of mandamus‚Äù which is just fancy lawyer speak for asking a court to order the government to take action on a case‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to know what it is called to use it.

Oftentimes immigration cases get stuck languishing for months and even years at USCIS. However, suing the government can be a fast solution to make USCIS finally review (and hopefully approve) your case.

Our team at DGO Legal - De Girolamo Oyhanarte LLP just won a case in 24 hours! 

Our clients were waiting for their asylum employment authorization documents (EADs) to be approved for over 90 days, even though the law requires USCIS to come to a decision on these cases within 30 days. Our clients tried to contact USCIS through all the normal routes to try to get a resolution, but nothing worked.

So, we prepared our filing (called a ‚Äúcomplaint‚Äù) to sue the U.S. government and provided it to the U.S. attorney, giving the government a heads up that we intended to sue USCIS.

The U.S. attorney quickly responded that the office would contact USCIS to see if the case could be resolved.

Less than 24 hours later our clients‚Äô EADs were approved.

Not much. But here is one *NEW* exception...

You can sue the consulate to correct an unfair denial. BUT...  

üçë And this is a BIG but üçë

You can probably only do this if your spouse is a U.S. citizen.

Most of the time you CANNOT sue the consulate for an unfair/unlawful/unreasonable denial.

This is because of the "doctrine of consular non-reviewability."  

This is a fancy way of saying: you're not allowed to ask a court review (and reverse) a consular officer's decision, even if it is against the law.

But you may be able to get around this restriction, IF the consulate denied your green card AND you are married to a U.S. citizen.

It's a small exception.  But worth knowing.

1Ô∏è‚É£ If your visa says "subject to 212(e)" then you are required to return to your home country for 2 years after your J-1.

2Ô∏è‚É£ There are very few ways to get out of this requirement.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Even if you marry a US citizen you have to satisfy the home residency requirement before you can get a marriage green card. Unless you get a waiver.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Check all your DS-2019s to see why you are subject to the 2-year requirement (look for the checked boxes on page 1).

5Ô∏è‚É£ If your J-1 program received US government funding it's a lot harder to get a waiver.

6Ô∏è‚É£ If the only reason you are subject to the 2-year requirement is because of the "skills list" then you might be a good candidate for a waiver. 

7Ô∏è‚É£ You can call your home country's consulate (this is your home country's consulate based in the US, not the US consulate based abroad) to ask about the country's stance on no objection statements.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Some countries object to all waivers. Some countries grant them easily.

The J-1 is a great visa to come to the US on. But it comes with some unpredictable baggage, especially the 2-year home residency requirement.

Which one is better?

Short answer: Usually NIW.
HUGE exception: If you are born in India or China.

NIW is generally easier to get than EB1A. It has less requirements, less special criteria, and less of that "you must be Einstein to get this" kind of vibe.

That's not to say that the NIW is EASY. It is NOT for everyone who works in a field of national importance.

But generally, if you are not from India or China, I recommend trying NIW instead of EB1A.

For most of you, it won't.

---

Even though this is a big change in the law.

It's not a big change for most immigration applications.

It will only really impact you if you receive a DENIAL.

...which hopefully you won't!

If USCIS denies your EB-1A or O-1, for example...

And you challenge the denial in federal court...

Then, it might help you.

Because now, the federal court doesn't have to defer to USCIS's reasoning in the case.

The court can step in and say, no USCIS, your analysis of this grey area of the law (which is a lot of areas in immigration) is wrong.

In the past, the federal court couldn't disregard USCIS's decision so easily.

---

So although this Supreme Court case is big news for us lawyers (and you'll see a lot of buzz about it on this platform today), for you (immigrants/visa applicants), it's not a huge immediate change.

I am curious to see how it will shape/change immigration law.

But for now, don't expect it to drastically change anything for your immigration application.

I once came back to 70 emails after a 1hr lunch workout.

I would get anxiety every time I went on vacation because of the avalanche of emails awaiting me upon my return.

I spent all day replying to emails instead of doing my substantive work. 

I was not lawyering. I was an electronic file clerk, dragging and dropping my emails into my 100s of client folders.

Law school did not prepare me for this. 

Something had to CHANGE.

I scoured the internet for tips/tricks/email voodoo.

Here‚Äôs what I found that worked:

üïë Time-blocking. 

I started only opening my emails twice a day. Only on my computer. I took my work emails off my phone. And I followed the ‚Äútouch it once‚Äù approach. If I was opening the email I was replying, filing, or delegating it.

üõë Stop using the inbox as a to-do list.

I came up with a better to-do list tracker than my inbox. A place where I could actually prioritize tasks and not feel overwhelmed every time I opened my email because of all the tasks hanging out in my inbox.

üóë Delete all client folders.

I got rid of my 100s of folders. Now I basically have 3: FYI; To Do; Completed. I realized that the email search function is incredible. I started renaming my email subjects to make my emails even easier to find.

üì≠ Aim for 0 inbox each day

I aim to clear out my inbox everyday. This doesn‚Äôt always mean completing a response to every email. It might mean adding an email response to my to-do list for tomorrow. But at least I can evaluate its priority compared to other tasks instead of just hitting reply.

I am not perfect at this. Especially now in my current job where I don‚Äôt get so many emails a day. But I try. And it helps save me from the email spiral.

But don't be fooled by this "magic" language.

Instead...

Let's throw it out.

What do I mean?

Just focus on the work that you will be doing in the US.

And how this work is related to the work you've accomplished in the field so far.

Try to identify a narrow field that you are an expert in...

Then think about how you've contributed to it in the past and how you plan to contribute to it in the future.

This is what USCIS wants to know.

It's pretty simple.

But for some reason when it's called a "proposed endeavor," it sounds a lot more complicated.

So don't let NIW scare you with this fancy language.

It's simpler than you think.

We won after...
 
üò© The immigration court denied the client's case. 
üò© The BIA denied the client's case. 
 
We filed a 9th Circuit appeal challenging the denial.
 
3 months after we filed our brief, OIL (the agency that represents the government in these appeals) agreed to remand the case.

üòÅ This is a victory for the client.

The government agreed that there were some remaining issues in the case that should be addressed, so they aren't going to fight it at the 9th Circuit.
 
The client gets a new day in immigration court to correct the improper denial.

Huge shout out to the incredible immigration litigator David Gardner for bringing me in and guiding me through this case.

Post Date: Can I extend my H-1B past the 6yr max even if my PERM has not been filed yet?

Will I have to go through the lottery again?

With the lengthy PERM process, many people are running up against the 6yr H-1B max out date.

PERMs aren't getting filed before reaching the 5yr mark on the H-1B and people are scared they will have to go through the lottery again.

But I have good news.

Your PERM does not have to be filed by the 5yr mark on your H-1B.

You will still be eligible for an extension past the 6yrs on your H-1B once your PERM is filed and 365 days have gone by.

You will probably have a gap in employment.

You will probably have to leave the US.

But as long as your company is OK with this and will still have the PERM/I-140 position available to you, then you will be able to come back in H-1B.

You will not have to go through the H-1B lottery again.

This part of the law confuses me every time.  I always have to bring up the law and read it again.

Post Date: Do you want your child to get a green card?

Good news. It just got a little easier.

USCIS announced an update this week that will help more kids get green cards.

How?

By using a chart that will lock the child's green card eligibility date sooner.

Huh?

Ok stick with me here...

If you are applying for a green card, and your children are dependents in your case, then your kids must be under 21 to be eligible for the green card.

Because of major green card backlogs that can take 20+ years, your 1-year-old child could be over 21 by the time your green card becomes available. This is called "aging out."

So your child could be stuck without a green card (even when the rest of your family gets them).

Ok so how did it get better for kids?

USCIS announced they will lock in your child's age sooner.

USCIS typically uses 2 different charts to determine when someone is eligible to apply for a green card (2 charts in the visa bulletin).

I do not want to get into the weeds of the visa bulletin, because ew no one wants that, but what you need to know is that one chart is typically faster/better than the other (the "dates for filing" chart).

And USCIS is now saying, ok we will lock in your child's age for the green card based on this "better/faster" chart. This way, less time will pass and fewer kids will "age out."

Oof this is a confusing one. I hope this provides just a little clarity.

‚¨áÔ∏èKey takeaway‚¨áÔ∏è
Things just got a little better for kids waiting in long green card lines.

This is music to my ears. Especially after a rough road.

The client's story is a familiar one.

A green card improperly delayed, closed, or denied.

The applicant makes all possible efforts to get the case resolved.

- Daily USCIS contact center calls. No resolution. 
- USCIS Online Inquiry. No resolution.
- Ombudsman report. No resolution.
- Congressional inquiry. No resolution.

The ending is not so familiar.

- Hired DGO Legal - De Girolamo Oyhanarte LLP. Green card approved and received 10 days later.

How?

We could have sued the government, and we were ready. But we tried one last ditch effort to present the case clearly to USCIS. We wanted a fast and inexpensive solution for our client.

And it worked.

The client saved literally thousands of dollars avoiding federal litigation.

The green card arrived in 10 days.

The best part‚Ä¶the client found me on LinkedIn. Happy to report such a positive outcome for my LinkedIn community!

Your client comes into your office with a heavy ball.
 
You hold it for them when they are there.
 
When your client leaves you are supposed to give it back.

But sometimes you don't.
 
But if you don't, you keep loading up with more and more until you can't carry them anymore.
 
They all fall out of your arms.

Should you apply for a "compelling circumstances" EAD?

Probably not.

---

Why not?

‚ùìÔ∏è It's too unpredictable

Even though USCIS announced that a "compelling circumstances" EAD might help laid-off tech workers, we have no idea how USCIS is going to interpret it in this context. It's up to the USCIS officer to decide whether your circumstances are compelling enough. And a layoff alone is probably not enough.

‚è≥Ô∏è It will take too long

EADs take a long time.  Think 6-8 months, but sometimes even more.  During this time you can't work. And in the end, you could get a denial.

üÜò It can cause future immigration problems

Even if you get an EAD approval, you are not in any status.  You have work authorization, but that's it.  This is similar to DACA, meaning that the US government isn't going to deport you, but you are not in any underlying status.  Without status, you typically can't change status (like back to H-1B) or adjust status (to get a green card).

Unfortunately, leaving the US may be the safest path to preserve your future U.S. immigration options.

Want to build your EB-1A profile? 
Here's what NOT to do...

Contribute only to your company.

You might work for a top international company. 
You might receive the company's top awards.
You might have a super high salary.
You might judge 100s of employees' work.
You might have transformed the company.  

I'm impressed. 
But USCIS will not be. 

To win EB-1A, you need to show how you are influencing people outside of just the company you work for.

These people need to be within your field.

For example, if you are a data scientist, how are other data scientists relying on your work? What method did you create within data science that changed the way data scientists do things?

If you only have evidence that you contributed to your company (and even your company's major clients), this is not enough.

Your EB-1A will fail.

The good news is, you can avoid this!

Focus on opportunities in your industry outside of your company, and you'll put yourself in a better position for EB-1A.

D&B is a website that tracks businesses. 

USCIS uses it to verify that the information in your immigration application is correct (that everything VIBEs). 

If the information on the D&B website about the employer sponsor is different than what is in your immigration application, you will likely face problems...think RFEs, NOIDs, oh my!

So before you file, make sure the employer D&B is up to date.

Post Date: I need to say something potentially controversial.
 
I HATE the words "evangelist" and "evangelize."
 
Unless you are working in a church spreading Christian gospel, I do  not want to see these words to describe a job.
 
More and more I see tech companies with job titles like "Evangelist" and job descriptions containing phrases like "evangelizing digital transformation." 
 
When I see this, I think to myself, what does this person actually do on a day-to-day basis? Do they go door-to-door in countries throughout the world spreading the gospel of technology? Maybe they are doing proverbial door knocking, and I am sure they are doing important work, but I am still left not knowing what they actually do in a typical day at work.
 
What does this have to do with immigration law? Am I just venting about other professions that have nothing to do with my own? 
 
Well no, attorneys who practice business immigration must explain to U.S. immigration officers‚Äîin the most concise and easily  digestible format‚Äîwhy a job qualifies for a specific kind of immigration status (a.k.a. visa).
 
So, if I am spending a lot of time racking my brain about what an evangelist actually does on the day-to-day, you better believe an officer with an overburdened workload and sometimes just 2-5 minutes to review your case does not want to be spending time pondering the same thing. And if it‚Äôs your application, you definitely don‚Äôt want them to be confused the moment they read your job title. I am not saying an ‚Äúevangelist‚Äù role won‚Äôt get an employment-based immigration visa, I am just saying why don‚Äôt we make our lives easier and throw out this bewildering term so we don‚Äôt have to spend time unpacking what it means.
 
Ok that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôll step off my pulpit, I am done evangelizing the "elimination of evangelism‚Äù in tech.

Post Date: I recently received 2 pieces of critical feedback.

One from my father and one from my employer.

The feedback from my father came after I went on a trip and left my son with my parents for the first time. As the Type A mom that I am, I left detailed notes for my parents to help them with caring for my 3-month old. When I came back from the trip, my dad left an ‚ÄúEdited Copy‚Äù of these notes on my kitchen counter, pointing out that I misspelled ONE word. I couldn‚Äôt believe that he edited my quickly typed out baby checklist‚Äîof course I did not spellcheck it! 

But at the same time, I could believe it, because it was exactly what my whole childhood was like. I was lucky enough to have a father who devoted time to editing my work from day one‚Äîfrom continually correcting my use of ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚Äúme,‚Äù to pulling the massive dictionary out at dinner to define words I didn‚Äôt know, to providing me ‚Äúedited copies‚Äù of my high school Heart of Darkness essay into the wee hours of the night.  Although this critical feedback was not always fun‚Äîthere were certainly more than a few tear-filled arguments‚Äîwith each edit, I became a better writer. I learned that my dad was coming from a place of kindness and that he gave me so much feedback because he wanted me to succeed. 

As a surprise to probably no one, my dad‚Äôs feedback style has influenced the way I give feedback in the workplace. 

This brings me to the second piece of critical feedback I received recently. My colleague advised me that an area where I have room for improvement is in how I deliver critical feedback to others. This also showed up on a management test I took, which stated: ‚ÄúLikely to give feedback in a critical, negative manner.‚Äù

This personal feedback was not new to me, it‚Äôs something that has come up before and something I absolutely want to work on. From a young age my dad indoctrinated me into an ‚Äúall edits and critical feedback come from a positive place‚Äù mentality‚Äîno matter the delivery or amount of feedback given. But I recognize that judgment can seep into critical feedback, and that never feels good. 

So now, I am working on making sure my critical feedback doesn‚Äôt come from a place of judgment. 

And guess what? 

I‚Äôll be keeping my dad‚Äôs ‚ÄúEdited Copy‚Äù as a reminder to check myself on how and when I deliver feedback.

Most likely, yes.

But the super risk-averse lawyer in me always waits for the physical approval notice to truly celebrate.

I've never had USCIS change its mind after an emailed approval notice.

But I've seen USCIS do some other unpredictable things.

So I always want my clients to know that there is some tiny risk that the outcome could change.

USCIS could say hey, we didn't mean to send that email.

This is within the realm of possibility.

It's my job to identify the risk.

But now she has an approval in hand.

When we first met, we talked about strategies to build her profile.

And just 6 months later she came back having done the work.

6 months. 

That's all it took to be NIW-ready.

So we went forward on her NIW.

She didn't wait for her employer to start the PERM process.

Now she has an I-140 approval.

Building your NIW profile works!!

And it's much faster than waiting around for PERM.

P.S. We did not submit evidence of her citation record, she had plenty of other persuasive evidence. There's no requirement that you have to give USCIS your Google Scholar page.

1Ô∏è‚É£ You can be FIRED. If you are a founder, you probably want control over your business.  But complete control is BAD for your H-1B.  The board of directors must have the true ability to fire you.  Your incorporation docs should reflect this.  And if possible, it's best if you own less than 50% of the business.

2Ô∏è‚É£ You will be paid a SALARY.  You may be tempted to pay yourself in only equity/not pay yourself at all.  But for an H-1B you must make at least a "prevailing wage." This is a specific amount set by the US government.  You must show that your company can afford to pay this salary (think at least $500k in the bank).

3Ô∏è‚É£ You have LUCK.  You only have a ~30% chance of getting an H-1B. Unless you already have one, then you don't need the luck... You can change employers and you don't have to face the lottery system again.

Post Date: Is it worth the $$ to hire a PR agency for your NIW/EB1?

Yes, but...

Not any old PR firm.

Wait...I thought "there's no such thing as bad publicity?"

Guess, what? for NIW/EB1 there can be, kind of.

What do I mean?

Bad PR:
- You pay money to get your name out in major media publications 
- The PR company copy and pastes your resume
- A media company is willing to post a summary of it
- The publication has no other commentary

Bad PR looks like a copy-paste job. It seems random. It leaves the reader wondering, why should I care?

Good PR:
- The PR company is used to working in your industry
- The PR company builds relationships with major media over time
- A journalist reaches out to the PR company about your field
- The PR company puts you in touch with the journalist 
- You give your take as the known expert in the field

Good PR looks organic. It shows that you are a trusted expert. This is what you want for NIW/EB1.

So if you have the means to use a PR agency, pick your PR agency wisely. Ask for examples.

Determine if the agency will give you good PR or bad PR before spending the big bucks!

How?

- Start posting regularly
- Talk about your field 
- Find a niche to discuss
- Write in easy to understand language
- Engage with people in your field from around the world

What could happen? LinkedIn Benefits.

- Others in your field will start to recognize you as a leader
- You get invited to speak at events/professional conferences
- You get invited to write in a professional journal
- You get featured in a publication
- Worst case: you practice talking about your expertise

What does this have to do with EB1, NIW, or O-1?

- You need to show widespread recognition in your field
- You need experts to write support letters (strangers=good)
- You need evidence of your leadership, like through conference presentations, publications, and media recognition
- You need to explain to an immigration officer in easy to understand language WHY your field is important

Hmm these seem pretty similar to the benefits you get from LinkedIn.

And the BEST PART...

You don't need a ton of followers to get results. I got 3 of these "LinkedIn Benefits" with less than 1,000 followers.

Post Date: Did you travel over the holidays? Are you back to work getting into the swing of things?

For most of us the answer is yes‚Äîthough some of us had flights cancelled so our trips home were delayed‚Äîmy cousins had to rent a car and drive with their two kids from Pennsylvania to Denver and then fly to Seattle just to get home!

Maybe you have unpacked your bag, gone to the grocery store and stocked your fridge and you have ticked everything off your to do list. 

But, if you are a foreign national on a temporary visa in the United States, there is one more item I‚Äôd like to add to your post-holiday to do list: check your I-94.

Anyone who is in a temporary status in the United States is likely familiar with the I-94‚Äîthe record that CBP gives you when you enter the United States to reflect your current status and how long you may remain in the country in that status.

If you are coming back to the United States from a trip abroad, you should check your I-94 on the CBP website to ensure that it is accurate. 

Let‚Äôs say you check your I-94 and everything looks good. Great, you can stop there. 

But, what happens if you catch a mistake? Unfortunately, there is no easy way to edit your I-94, so you might be stuck with a CBP mistake, but it‚Äôs good to know what mistakes to stress about and what mistakes to let go.

Some mistakes‚Äîlike your ‚ÄúClass of Admission‚Äù being L-1A instead of L-1B or your old passport number being listed‚Äîare not super concerning and can typically be left unaddressed.

As a general rule the mistake that you should be the most concerned/aware of is the ‚ÄúAdmit Until Date.‚Äù You need to know how long CBP admitted you because that is how long you can lawfully remain in the United States. If the I-94 date of admission is shorter than you expected this can be because of a CBP officer mistake or sometimes because your passport is expiring soon. Either way, this is the date that controls how long you can stay in the United States‚Äîeven if it is incorrect, it is what you MUST follow. 

If you check your I-94, find a mistake, and discover that you have stayed past your ‚ÄúAdmit Until Date‚Äù DO NOT go to CBP to try to get it corrected!!! I repeat, DO NOT go to CBP to try to get it corrected. You could be removed (aka deported) if you show up in this circumstance‚Äîeven if CBP was the one who made the mistake! If you end up in this situation it can be critical to talk to an immigration attorney to determine the best path to get back into status before taking any other steps on your own.

If you check your I-94 and find a mistake on the ‚ÄúAdmit Until Date‚Äù but you are still within that date, then you can consider going to the CBP office to see if they will correct it, but it‚Äôs possible they may be unwilling to change it. If that is the case, the next time you travel abroad CBP will issue you a new I-94, which you will check again and see if it has the correct ‚ÄúAdmit Until Date.‚Äù 


Any other useful I-94 dos and don‚Äôts to add to the ‚Äúreview I-94‚Äù to do list?

Post Date: 3 expert support letter hacks 
(for O1, EB1A, or NIW).

If you are drafting an expert support letter for an immigration case the work can seem daunting. 

Here are 3 ways to make it easier:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Use ChatGPT to get ideas

Use prompts like "explain in nontechnical terms [insert your field of expertise]" or "explain why [insert specific tool/field/project you've done] is critical to the U.S. national interest." 

Be sure to review and MAKE EDITS. ChatGPT is a great way to start/get ideas flowing, but it should not be your end product. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use LinkedIn PDF resumes 

If it's too hard to track down resumes/CVs from experts, then you can use LinkedIn resume printouts instead.

Did you know that you can download a pretty PDF version of someone's LinkedIn profile that looks like a resume? Go to the person's profile, select the "More" button then select "Save to PDF" and you'll get a nice-looking resume to download. 

3Ô∏è‚É£ Use the Draw Tool in Word for signatures

Scanned original signatures are ideal for USCIS (and are required on the forms and certain support docs). But if it's not possible for an expert support letter (who has a printer these days anyway?), we've had success with USCIS accepting expert letters that are signed with the Draw Tool in Word.  

Go to the "Draw" tab at the top of Word and select the pen, then sign on the signature line with your mouse.

---

...Ok, now you can go back to you know being an expert in your field and doing things in the national interest rather than stressing about support letters.

Post Date: #1 Secret about the O-1 visa.

It's easier than EB-1A.

---

On paper, the O-1 and EB-1A are nearly identical.

But in practice the O-1 is much easier to get. 

So if you don't think your profile is ready for EB-1A, don't let that stop you.

But...and this is a big BUT...

You need a U.S. job offer for the O-1. Unlike the EB-1A.  

You cannot sponsor yourself. 

But you can get creative if you are a founder.  You can set up your business in a way to make the O-1 work.

So it may be worth trying out the O-1.

Post Date: 1 thing every startup should know about immigration:

‚û°Ô∏èThe ownership/voting/board structure of a company can impact a founder‚Äôs immigration status. 

‚Äî‚Äî

For some visas, you want the founder to have more than 50% of ownership. For other visas, you want the founder‚Äôs ownership to be less than 50%.  

So if you have an immigrant founder (or early team member), you want to  consider immigration options the moment you are drafting your articles of incorporation.

You can always restructure your business later, but you‚Äôll save time and money if immigration was already a part of the equation.

Post Date: Can you travel on your O-1 while your adjustment of status is pending?

‚ùåüò± Google gets this answer wrong üò±‚ùå

Google says, sure go ahead and travel.  But...please DON'T.

Why not?

Grey area in the law.

Huh? 

It's not clear whether an O-1 is "dual intent." 

I still don't get it?

A dual intent visa allows you to be in the US on a temporary visa, but also show that you intend to remain in the US permanently (by filing for adjustment of status).  

If you have a temporary visa without dual intent, the US government says: 

Hey, wait a minute, you said you wanted to stay in the US temporarily, now you are trying to stay here permanently.  These things are inconsistent. So, we can't let you back into the country on your temporary visa.

Then you are stuck outside the US & you abandoned your adjustment of status application.

So, what's the issue with the O-1?

The US Department of State says the O-1 is dual intent.  

Ok great, then why can't I travel?

Because USCIS hasn't said one way or the other that the O-1 is dual intent. And USCIS is the one deciding your adjustment of status application.

So to be safe, don't travel abroad on your O-1.  Wait until you get your Advance Parole.

-Money
-Immigration status

I'll go first...

I would do the same job.
I would be an immigration attorney. 
I would just select a few complex cases. 

This way I could be challenged, provide top-of-the-line client service and never feel overwhelmed (ok maybe not never...it's still immigration we are talking about).

When I shared this answer with my legal assistant, who originally posed the question, he said...

 "How amazing! You are living your dream."

Sadly, I never thought about it that way.

It's easy to get caught up in the competing deadlines, ever-changing laws, 
incorrectly rejected applications, emotional stress of your clients having to upend their lives because of a lottery or layoff, and frustrations of dismissed cases the day before trial after you've already prepped the client and written the brief.

It was a great wake-up call.

I am fortunate to be living my dream...and of course not to have to worry about my own immigration status.

A birth certificate can be called a "birth abstract," "birth record," "Acta de Nacimiento," "l‚ÄôActe de Naissance," and many more names. There are short forms, long forms, and commemorative copies.
 
So how do you know which one is correct?

10 years?!?! 

Doesn‚Äôt it seem a bit extreme?

Yes & no,

Yes, because... 

Last month you could apply for EB1 if you had a priority date in 2022. And this month it went backwards 10 years.

No, because...

It won't actually be a 10-year retrogression. The 2012 date is basically a placeholder until October. The government is saying we've reached the amount of EB1s we can give out for India this year.

The government resets green card numbers in October. 

So you can expect the dates to be more like the July Visa Bulletin for EB1 starting in October.

Key takeaways:
‚Ä¢ The August Visa Bulletin for EB1 India is not as bad as it looks. 
‚Ä¢ It still makes sense for Indian nationals to pursue EB1.

They are often willing to sponsor immigrant employees. 

Colleges & universities get special treatment by U.S. immigration (for example, they aren't subject to the H-1B cap).

- Operations specialists
- Marketing officers
- Product managers

- Data scientists

Ok, "never" might be too strong.

But the point is, you want to avoid business jargon as much as possible.  

If your job title has one of these terms in it, you will obviously need to include it. And I've seen a lot of job titles with these terms.

I get it...these are common terms in corporate America. So why can't you use them in immigration applications?

Because most immigration officers do not have a background in business or tech. So they probably won't know what you mean.

And what happens when immigration officers don't know what you mean?

RFEs & denials.

So next time you describe your job for immigration, ask yourself, would my grandma understand this?

If not, choose a different word.

Post Date: Watch out for this O-1 visa Catch 22.

If you want to sponsor yourself for an O-1, you can't.

But you might be able to use an agent instead.

This can work well for actors, artists, athletes, or other freelance-type positions.

However, if you use an agent then you'll run into‚Ä¶

The O-1 Catch 22.

USCIS requires that you show a detailed itinerary of the work you will be doing for the next 3 years (if you want it to be approved for the max amount of time).

You must show contracts for specific projects you will be working on.

Your work cannot be speculative.

The problem is that most clients/businesses don't want to commit to working with you unless you can secure a visa.

So then you are stuck in a loop...

Unable to obtain the contracts that you need to secure the visa.

Stuck in a frustrating Catch 22 of business realities vs. immigration laws.

It's not impossible to get out of, but it can be a challenge.

Post Date: One GOOD thing about getting laid off by your H-1B employer.

You probably don't have to repeat the lottery.

ü§î What does this mean?

If you are on an H-1B, getting laid off is SCARY. Your visa status in the U.S. is tied to your employer. So now you have to frantically look for a new job.

‚ÜóÔ∏è Let's say you don't find one.  And you have to leave the U.S.
‚ÜôÔ∏è Let's say you are outside the U.S. for many years.
‚ÜóÔ∏è But then you find your dream job and you want to come back.

GOOD NEWS.  Your new employer likely won't need to go through the H-1B lottery for you to get your visa.

If you already went through the H-1B lottery (aka you were cap-subject), then you likely don't have to deal with the lottery again. As long as you were in your previous H-1B job for less than 6 years, you can use the rest of that time up in a new H-1B.  Even if it's for a job months, years, or decades later.

‚û°Ô∏èSo while getting laid off does not feel good, remind yourself that you are a lottery winner.  Maybe that will help?

Post Date: 3rd most common H-1B layoff question answered.

Can I change my status to B-2?

Answer: Maybe, but be aware of BIG RISKS.

---

If you try to change to B-2 to stay in the US and hunt for H-1B jobs past your grace period...

You could face major immigration problems in the future.

To get a B-2 visa you need to show that you only intend to remain in the US temporarily to be a tourist. 

But if that's not really your plan (and maybe you've renewed your H-1B for MANY years waiting for your priority date to become current), it's going to be hard to convince immigration you only want to be in the US temporarily.

So immigration could deny your case, or worse, deny a different visa in the future.

B-2 can work for some H-1Bs (maybe if you just started your first H-1B in October 2022 and you want to do some touristy things before you depart the US). 

But BE AWARE. 

It's not a magic solution to extend your H-1B grace period.

This sounds scary. Will the U.S. government seek revenge on you? Will the consulate make things worse?

Instead, you get a federal court to put pressure on the U.S. government to take action on your case.

Post Date: What does it mean when USCIS is "actively reviewing" your case?

Almost nothing.

It could still mean you will be waiting months or even years.

It could still mean you get an RFE.

I've had a green card renewal case in the "actively reviewing" stage since 2022.

Two years of active review.

I imagine that it means that your case has been assigned to a specific officer.

So it's in the officer's pile of cases to review.

But...

We have no idea how big that pile is.

So even though it's exciting to see your case status change online...

From "receipt received" to "actively reviewing," this doesn't tell you much about your case.

There's no normal amount of time for something to be "actively reviewed."

So sadly, we can't get too excited about it.

If you have not used your max 6 years in H-1B, you can come back into the US with a new H-1B without going through the H-1B lottery again. 

And if you already maxed out your 6 years in H-1B, but you've been renewing your H-1B based on your approved I-140 (with a priority date that is not current yet), you can also come back in on H-1B without going through the lottery again.

Post Date: Are you in the process of getting your EB2 or EB3 green card (through PERM)? 
 
If so, watch out for the new PERM form.
 
Why?
 
The Department of Labor (DOL) is launching a new online PERM form in June.
 
Even though the law has not changed, the form's questions are different. Significantly different.
 
And PERM is the least flexible immigration form.
 
A tiny typo can lead to a denial (after 1-2 years in the process).
 
Things that were acceptable on the past PERM form may be rejected by DOL.
 
Employers and law firms have used many years of experience with the current PERM form to figure out the magic language to avoid a denial.
 
Now all this institutional knowledge is going away.
 
We don't get to try it out and see what will work.

We don't get to send test cases.
 
It's like launching a product without a single prototype. 
 
We have to launch our cases (that directly impact your lives!!) out into the world using the new system and hope they work.
 
So be prepared, the launch is unlikely to go smoothly. There will be denials. There will be hard lessons. 

Are you scared yet? I am too.
 
What can you do?

Maybe it's time to think about NIW or EB1 to protect yourself from this PERM doom and gloom?

Post Date: I'm on a visa, can I volunteer?

Yes & no.

...Everyone's favorite answer.

If you're on a visa like an H-1B or even a nonwork visa like a B2, you might want to volunteer in the US while you are here.

Is the volunteering you want to do OK?

YES if...

‚Ä¢ The position is normally a volunteer position.
‚Ä¢ The position is not typically a paid position

NO if...

‚Ä¢ The position would normally be paid 
‚Ä¢ The work is not normally done by a volunteer

---

So let's say you are on an H4 and you are not eligible for an EAD yet. You have a degree in landscape architecture. You'd like to volunteer at a landscape architecture firm while you are in the US.

Is this allowed?

No, probably not.

Why?

Because you would be doing work that would normally be done by a paid landscape architect.

But if you want to volunteer at a plant conservatory where there are normally unpaid docents...

Is this allowed?

Yes.

Volunteering can seem harmless/helpful...but even that can cause immigration issues üò©

Post Date: Want to sponsor yourself for an H-1B
...But heard you can't?

In 2024 this could change.

And NOW is a good time to take advantage of it.

The H-1B lottery registration will be in March 2024. 

If you want to include yourself in the H-1B lottery for this upcoming year then you need to have your company set up before the registration period.

The new proposed rule would allow a company to sponsor a founder even if the founder has majority ownership over the company.

There will be some restrictions.

For example, the H-1B will initially be approved for only 18 months (instead of 3 years).

And we don't know for sure if this rule will go forward.

But if it does, and you don't plan ahead, you might miss the upcoming H-1B lottery registration.

So if you've ever thought about founding a company and using the company to sponsor yourself for an H-1B, this is a good time to start!

Post Date: What no one told you about getting a green card through your employer (aka PERM).

‚Ä¢ It takes FOREVER
  
‚Ä¢ The current PERM process is taking around 1.5-2yrs
  
‚Ä¢ Going through the process does not guarantee a green card
  
‚Ä¢ It's not about YOU
  
‚Ä¢ It's your employer's application
  
‚Ä¢ Even though it will impact your life, your employer gets to control the process
  
‚Ä¢ You might not even be able to talk to your employer's immigration attorney about it
  
‚Ä¢ The law requires that you are completely left out of certain parts of the process (like the recruitment)
  
‚Ä¢ You can travel internationally while the entire process pending (even once the PERM is filed and even once the I-140 is filed)
  
‚Ä¢ Even if you are not on a dual-intent visa
  
‚Ä¢ The first step in the process (getting the US gov to tell you what wage you must be paid) takes 7-9 months
  
‚Ä¢ The PERM process is usually successful for the immigrant employee, but...
  
‚Ä¢ There is very little room for error in PERM
  
‚Ä¢ A tiny typo can blow up the entire application
  
‚Ä¢ Unlike other immigration applications where a typo can be fixed, in PERM it usually cannot
  
‚Ä¢ Immigration attorneys are human, as much as we want to believe we are perfectionist robots, we are not immune from typos (this is what keeps me up at night)
  
‚Ä¢ Many law firms are old-fashioned and don't use technology to automate tasks (leaving more room for human error)
  
‚Ä¢ Even law firms that serve major tech companies
  
‚Ä¢ PERM tasks can be difficult to automate to reduce human error
  
‚Ä¢ Every state has different advertising requirements, different online platforms where we must post ads, and different details required
  
‚Ä¢ So even when we want to automate, it can be difficult to remove the human element entirely
  
‚Ä¢ The purpose of PERM is to determine if there are any minimally qualified US workers for your role
  
‚Ä¢ The recruitment will be different than it was for your role originally
  
‚Ä¢ The advertising requirements are old-fashioned (ads will be in newspapers, as required by law)
  
‚Ä¢ If someone applies who is qualified for the position then that PERM process is over
  
‚Ä¢ But your employer does not have to hire that person
  
‚Ä¢ Your employer can restart the PERM process if the first one doesn't work
  
‚Ä¢ Even if/when your PERM is certified, you still have several steps until you get your green card
  
‚Ä¢ You won't be able to apply for your green card right away
  
‚Ä¢ You will probably have to wait in a green card line

PERM is a bumpy, long, and curvy road. 

You will feel out of control. 

But if you hold on tight it can often lead to a green card.

üò± And it wasn't how to be a good lawyer. üò±

So what was it?

How to speak/write before I feel ready.

The bar exam forced me to just START.

I could never master all 10 topics. I could prepare. But the bar exam would (and did) test me on things I didn't know.

I remember feeling so uncomfortable on my practice tests. Spitting out what I felt was B.S. üò¨üò¨üò¨

I hated it.

I wanted to study more, research more, know more. 

But I couldn't.  

I had to just write.

I started to exercise the muscle. One I never used before.

I got stronger. 

And now it's a skill I ACTUALLY USE as a lawyer (unlike all those other fun bar exam skills like hearsay rules, modern per stirpes, and contract consideration).

Of course I want to be prepared for my clients. And not to B.S. my way through life.

But it's not practical to research something for 1000s of hours until I feel like there is NO RISK. Or to rewrite an email or brief a billion times until it's a polished gem.

So I have to speak/write before I am ready.

And thanks to the bar exam, now I can.

If less people actually apply or are not eligible for the H-1Bs selected then USCIS could open up the lottery selection process again.

So if you are already registered it's possible you could selected for the lottery in the future.

He said, you need to learn to delegate to me.

I said, I don't know how! 

But I do know how. 

I do it at work all the time. I train staff, I make checklists, I create SOPs.

But I never thought about doing it at home.

I didn't want to give up control. I wanted the items packed in my particular way.

But I also don't want to stay up late packing by myself before every trip.

So I need to learn to delegate.

Post Date: üõë Why being related to a U.S. citizen can be a BAD thing. üõë

Most of the time being related to a U.S. citizen is a good thing for immigration.  But here is one exception...

PERM.

If you are related to the business owner who is sponsoring you, this could cause problems.

The US government wants to make sure that the business has a real job offer available to US workers. But they think that if you're related to the business owner, then you are the only candidate they really had in mind for the position.

So what does this mean for your PERM case? The business will have to disclose the family relationship (no matter how distant!). And you should expect an audit, which will delay your PERM.

It's hard to predict whether the family relationship will lead to a denial.  Luckily, I have heard of success stories for family relationship PERMs (after an audit).

But that doesn't change the headache that you will face just because you are related...family (PERM) drama.

Think of the Executive Order as a little extra plus at the end of your application.

Set up a Google Scholar profile page.

If you have any academic publications or patents, make sure they are listed on your Google Scholar page.  Once you set up your profile, regularly review it to make sure it is accurate.

Google Scholar gives you fancy graphs that track your citation record over time.  

You will immediately look more official in the eyes of USCIS.

USCIS loves to look at Google Scholar pages to track your publications/patents/citations/influence in the field.  

So if you are considering applying for EB1A or NIW in the future, Google Scholar is an easy place to start.

Because you will need to show how YOU are a leader in your field.

You will be a pro at explaining what you do and why it delivers value.

This is what immigration officers want to hear.

NIW will not get you in a faster green card line. EB-1A will.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean you should only focus on EB-1A.

NIW has its benefits too.
NIW is easier to get than EB-1A.
NIW is faster than the long PERM process.
NIW is not tied to your employer.
NIW allows you to retain your priority date for your EB-1A case.
NIW can help you show USCIS that you are EB-1A eligible.

Here‚Äôs the but‚Ä¶

If you pursue NIW and then EB-1A you‚Äôll have to spend time, energy, and money on each application. 

That‚Äôs a big but. Not everyone can afford to do both. 

But it‚Äôs useful to know the benefits of the NIW.

It‚Äôs ultimately up to you to determine if these benefits are worth the long journey and cost of NIW to EB-1A.

Am I stuck? 
Do I get to keep my priority date?
Will have to start all over again?

If you go through the long PERM process and get all the way to an approved I-140, you might be wondering, what happens if I leave my job?

Do I get to keep my I-140?

Or was it all a waste?

The good news:
‚Ä¢ You get to keep your priority date
‚Ä¢ You can extend your H-1B over 6yrs

The bad news:
‚Ä¢ You can't use the old job/I-140 for a green card
‚Ä¢ You need a new I-140

So you don't have to compeltely start over, because you have secured a priority date (the place in line to get your green card).

But...if your priority date becomes current (aka you get to the front of the green card line), you can't get your green card based on your old I-140, because that job is no longer what you will be doing in the US.

You will need your new employer to go through the PERM/I-140 process for you.

OR...

You will need a self-petitioned I-140, like an NIW or EB-1 that will allow you to take your I-140 wherever you go.

This is one of the main benefits of the NIW.

It doesn't get you in a faster green card line.

But, it saves you the stress of feeling tied to your employer.

NIW is a great tool for job flexibility.

It allows you to say goodbye to the continual PERM stress with each job change.

1. You can win without any citations
2. Expert letters don't matter that much
3. Defining your field is CRITICAL
4. Use the EB1A criteria as a guide 
5. The last requirement is NOT important

---

üìä USCIS loves citations, but you can show your impact through other metrics. Especially if you're not an academic.

‚úçÔ∏è Expert letters explain your impact in the field, but they will NOT win your case. The other evidence is much more important.

ü§ì Your field should not be too broad or too narrow (it's like goldilocks). If you get it right, you can show a clear narrative of why YOU are the expert. This is what USCIS wants to see.

üëØ The NIW criteria are deceptively simple (only 3 main requirements). But USCIS often looks at the EB1A criteria as a guide. So if you are building your NIW profile, take a look at the EB1A criteria.

üòÆ The last criterion for NIW is that "it is beneficial to waive the job offer and labor certification requirement." But if you meet the other requirements for NIW, it will be easy to show this. So, don't worry about it.  Worry about the other requirements instead.

Any other secrets you would add?

---

If these secrets look familiar, that's because they are.  The first 3 secrets are the EXACT SAME for EB1A.  If you are building your profile for NIW you are also building your profile for EB1A.

It means you've contributed something new/different to your field.

If this is just 1 of the criteria, why do you need it?
 
Because the EB-1A is all about your impact on your field as a whole.
 
If you can't explain how you've contributed to the field in an original way, then you probably can't show you are a leader in the field.
 
So if you're trying to figure out which EB-1A criteria to focus on, make sure you put "original contributions" on your list!

Post Date: How much are the filing fees? 
What form do I use?
Where do I mail my application?

Simple enough questions.

But answering them is harder than an SAT logic problem.

Especially as we head into April 1st.

USCIS is using "received by April 1st" for some of the answers.

And "postmarked by April 1st" for other parts.

So...if you are filing an H-1B, mailing it out on 3/31, arriving after April 1 your fees will not increase, you can use the old forms, but you better not forget that you have to mail it to a new address.

And USCIS recently updated the filing addresses on the website.

So it's not clear if we should use those new addresses before April 1st or not.

Any wrong move could lead to a rejection.

...a rejection that will come back after the April 1 fee increase deadline.

So you'll have to pay more to refile it.

I always hated those SAT/LSAT logic questions.

I am not liking them anymore now IRL.

If you are an individual contributor at your company, you will need to show immigration how you have impacted the field as a whole outside of your company.

To do this, you want as much external validation/recognition as possible.

The more external recognition you can get, the better.

You will be up against this feeling/presumption at USCIS that maybe you've done a great job at your company, but you haven't really influenced the field as a whole.

So to do this, you want to show that places outside of your company and clients/customers recognize the importance of your work.

Media recognition & awards will really help here.

You may be tempted to focus on other criteria like:

‚Ä¢ judging
‚Ä¢ critical contribution at a distinguished org
‚Ä¢ high salary

But so many other people will be focusing on these too.  

It's relatively easy to become a peer reviewer, and if you are at a top company in a senior role you are probably making a high salary.

But these distinctions will not win your case.

You will need more.

That's why you want to look at the other criteria and see how you can get that external recognition.

That's what will help convince USCIS that you deserve EB-1A.

...even if you're not an academic.

 1. Stop stressing about citations. They don't matter.
    
 2. Narrow your focus (pick a specific area within your field)
    
 3. Tell your manager you are looking for publicly-facing opportunities
    
 4. Ask your manager if he/she knows about any industry organizations (outside of your company) 
    
 5. Ask your former professors about professional associations in your field
    
 6. Join at least one of these organizations
    
 7. Look for leadership positions within the organizations
    
 8. Volunteer to present at an industry conference (outside of your company)
    
 9. Google awards in your industry and see if you can get nominated (ask a colleague/mentor to nominate you, if that's what it takes)
    
10. Book a strategy session with me for personalized action items

P.S. You may have seen these steps before. They work for both academics and industry professionals, including software engineers and product managers. So don't be scared to try them even if you're not in a job that typically publishes, gives conference presentations, or gets citations.

Post Date: MAJOR UPDATE for laid-off immigrants.

Yesterday USCIS announced updates on when laid-off workers can use compelling circumstances EADs.

Good news: we got some clarity.
Bad news: it's not as helpful as you think

So, how do you know if it's right for you?

You can apply if:
- You are in H-1B, L-1, O-1, E-3
- You have an approved I-140
- Your visa number is not current
- You have not applied for AOS
- You can show financial hardship
- Your hardship is more than just job loss

But should you apply?

Probably not if:
- You need to work immediately
- You want to change status (like back to H-1B)
- You plan to adjust status
- You need to travel internationally

You cannot work while the EAD application is pending (can be 6-8mo). 

Even if it is approved, you just get work authorization for 1 year and NOTHING ELSE.

You won't have travel authorization (if you leave the US you cannot come back using the EAD).

You won't have status.

You are allowed to stay in the US, but without status, you can cause problems for your future immigration self.

Without status, you cannot "change status" or "adjust status." So you have to leave the US to process any new visa or green card.

For some people with no other options maybe the compelling circumstances EAD is worth it. 

But I would guess for most, it's not. 

Even with this USCIS update.

Post Date: Not selected for the H-1B lottery?

Considering Day 1 CPT? 

Here's why you shouldn't.

It could cause major problems for your future self.

...Because USCIS or DOS may deny a future application.

Just because your school approves your Day 1 CPT does not mean that you are safe.

CPT was designed to be an internship/training-type program that is integral to your F-1 studies.

It was not designed to be an alternative to the H-1B.

So if you are using Day 1 CPT to primarily work, not study, this can be a problem.

Let's say you are trying to use Day 1 CPT to go back to work at a place where you already did OPT.

Your school may not approve it because you already received the training.

But even if your school approves it, when you go to change status next year from F-1 to H-1B, USCIS will deny it.  

USCIS will say you that your Day 1 CPT should not have been approved and that you violated your F-1 status.

USCIS is aware of and especially critical of schools marketing Day 1 CPT.

So watch out!

Although Day 1 CPT is tempting, be careful. You don't want to sacrifice your future immigration paths for this quick fix.

Worried this means 1000000000000 registrants for 65000 slots?

Me too....So what to do?

Come up with an H-1B contingency plan.

Here are 5 options:

1) O-1 

Not as hard as an EB1A and you can take proactive steps now to build your O-1 profile.

2) H-1B cap exempt employer

Have you ever considered working for a college, university, or nonprofit research organization? They have all kinds of jobs, not just professor positions, and they are exempt from the cap (so no lottery required).

3) J-1 

Did you know that universities have incubator programs that work with startups and sponsor J-1s? This could be an option, just keep your eyes out for the 2-yr home residency requirement.

4) Marriage to your U.S. citizen girlfriend/boyfriend/partner

I know, I know, don't marry for the wrong reasons. But if you are in a real relationship, and in love, then you might want to consider this option, it truly is the fastest/best route.

5) F-1 Master's or PhD

This is probably the most common. People go back to school to obtain a higher degree. And if you pursue STEM then you get 3 yrs of OPT after graduation.

Cheers & happy H-1B registration season! May the odds be ever in your favor.

Dear employer,

I am reaching out to see if you would be open to sponsoring me for an O-1A visa.

I qualify for the O-1A because I am a national expert in [insert your field, be specific: ‚ùåsoftware engineering ‚úÖ AI for UX design prototyping].

My biggest contribution to the field is: [insert 1 thing that you have done in your field that no one else was doing before you came along].

I meet at least 3/10 O-1A criteria.

[Insert 3 bullet points only, here are examples:

‚ñ™Ô∏è Critical contribution to distinguished org: 
The tool I created for this company is now used by 300M people in the world and brings in XX revenue for the company. Other companies now mimic my tool. It has become an industry standard.

 ‚ñ™Ô∏è Media: 
I was interviewed by Forbes and Tech Crunch about the way AI impacts UX design and what are the up and coming trends in the industry.

 ‚ñ™Ô∏è Peer review: 
I peer reviewed 20 articles for a [insert name of one leading professional journal.]

Given my record, I am curious if you would be open to sponsoring my O-1.

Thank you,
[Your name]

---

Here's the key: 
Don't go into every detail. 

Keep it as concise as possible. 
Do not attach your evidence.

The person evaluating your O-1 eligibility does not have time to open up 1000s of pages of evidence. 

...Especially if you are talking to an immigration team at a major tech company. 

You need to summarize it. 

Make your employer's job easy, not hard.

A happy employer is more likely to approve your O-1 request.

But, it's not.

If you get a "Deficiency Notice" from USCIS you might think you (or your lawyer) messed something up in your immigration application.

But it's just a heads up.

Most of the time, USCIS is just telling you that you will need to complete your medical exam before your green card can be approved.

It's like a pre-RFE.  It will say, hey you, I see you didn't submit your application with a medical, in the future, we will ask you for it, but don't send it now.

So, it's really harmless.

I'm not sure why it needs to have such a scary name.  

No reason to be spooked. 

Think of it more as an "FYI notice."

But here are 2 good things about it.

1Ô∏è‚É£ You get to hold on to your priority date in EB3, EB2, and EB1

If you have an approved I-140 from a million years ago, you get to keep that priority date. Even if you file for EB1. So even if EB1 is backlogged for your home country, you might not need to wait. You get to jump the line.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Your EB2 or EB3 priority date is the date your PERM is filed, not approved.

This means that once it is approved (~5-9 months later) your priority date is a day in the past. So your case might be current very soon (if you are not from India or China). This is even with a visa bulletin backlog of ~11 months.


...A small sliver of hope/good news in the craziness of the visa bulletin.

None of these will "cancel out" what your employer is doing.

You can keep doing your PERM with them.

You don't have to tell your employer you are doing these things if you don't want to.

You may want to let them know once it is approved.

Some employers may even pay for your adjustment of status after NIW/EB-1 approval...

Even if you filed it without the employer.

So it could benefit you to let them know.

You will also want to let them know if they are filing an H-1B extension for you that you have an approved concurrent H-1B.

But otherwise, there is no requirement that you tell your employer.

You can build your profile.

But the law does allow it. If you need to.

You can travel back to the US using an expired 10-year green card. 

The expiration date on your green card should not stop you.

BUT...

You could have problems if:

üìÖ You were outside the US for 6 months or more 

If you were outside the US for 6 months or more then you might face some questions on whether you abandoned your permanent residence in the US. So you'll want to be prepared to show how you have maintained your permanent residence in the US during this time.

‚úàÔ∏è The airline won't let you on your plane

Airlines are charged if the immigration officers don't let you into the US when you arrive off your plane. So they often try to do an initial screening. One way to help prevent getting rejected can be showing this notice from CBP that says expired 10-year green cards are OK to travel on.

Post Date: Want a green card soon?

You'll probably have to wait. A while.

Why?

The U.S. government only gives out a certain number of green cards a year for each country.

High demand = long backlog.

The government just released the August Visa Bulletin.

This is the document that tells us how bad the backlog is.

And August is not looking good.

Indian EB1 priority date goes back to 2012. 
That's not a typo. 
2012.

Every country now has to wait for EB1 green cards.

EB3 now has a 3+ year wait for all countries. 
That's after you already go through the PERM process.
The PERM process that now takes 1.5-2 years.
5+ year process to get your green card.

This might get a little better in October when the government restarts the green card number count for the year.

But I wouldn't bank on a magical clearing of the backlogs.

If this isn't reason to get started ASAP on your green card plan, I don't know what is.

What is a tax transcript?

It's a record from the IRS that shows you actually filed & paid your taxes.

A copy of your completed tax return doesn't prove you actually filed it.

You could fake paying your taxes.

Because they prove that you actually filed and paid your taxes.

You probably already know that you need to meet 3/10 EB-1A criteria. But, that is not enough.  

You also need to ask this question.

How have I impacted the field/industry as a whole?

Maybe you've saved your company millions. Maybe you created an internal tool that everyone in your company relies on.

These accomplishments are impressive.

But did they impact the entire industry (not just your company)?

If your answer is "no" or "I don't know," that's ok.  

It doesn't mean you can't get an EB-1A.

It just means you need to work on more external-facing (outside of your company) accomplishments. 

Perhaps talk to your manager and see if you can participate in industry challenges, press statements, or judging competitions.

This way you can build a strong EB-1A profile.

ü§ì Phrases/words/acronyms like "enterprise," "evangelize," "digital transformation," "ML," and "ERP SAP" might be used constantly in your industry and make you sound smart.  But the immigration officer will not be impressed.  Only confused. So make the officer's life easier and explain your work in easy to understand terms.

üìú No blurry photos. No cut off articles. No teeny tiny font. No advertisements over the key part of the article quoting you. No photos without any explanation.  Remember this is the only evidence the officer has in your case, so make sure it is easy to read.

üíªÔ∏è Just like you can Google everything, so can the immigration officer. So expect the officer to see your LinkedIn (or any other public social media). Make sure your job title/location/description is generally consistent with your immigration application.

You still might get an RFE. But at least you can minimize your chances as much as possible.

Post Date: Want an NIW green card?

Stressed about building your profile?

Here's something you can STOP stressing about...

STOP stressing about showing that you work in a field of national interest.

Almost every field can meet this requirement.

Analytics?
In the national interest

Natural Language Processing?
In the national interest

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)?
In the national interest

Entrepreneurship?
In the national interest

Logistics?
In the national interest

I could go on and on.

You do not need to gather tons of documentation to show how your field is linked to the national interest.

Your attorney can do the leg work for you (gathering congressional reports and other evidence to link your field to the national interest).

So breathe easy and take this off your to-do list.

Happy NIW profile building!

Post Date: Tess Douglas - Thank you for your post.  I would like to add my 2 cents (or 3 dogecoin) to this issue:

** The issue here is the distinction between work and investment.

** If you set up a Schwab account and buy 3 shares of NVIDIA, then you own NVIDIA and you can benefit from the rise in the share price but you don't have permission to WORK for NVIDIA.  To work for NVIDIA requires work authorization through H-1B or whatever.

** The issue is clear for a large company, where shares are publicly traded.

** Now let's take it down to a small business situation.  If you put up your money to buy a rental property, that is arguably an INVESTMENT.  You are using your $$ to do something and not your effort (work).  Now if you decide to basically spend 40 hours per week fixing up houses and flipping them, now you have probably crossed the line from INVESTMENT to WORK and you need authorization to do the work.

** Content creation is not investment.  It is work.  Buying things and flipping them on EBAY (do people still do that?) is also work.  Investment is where you are using financial resources to grow.

I actually think the rules can make sense in this context even if sometimes limiting and frustrating.

I am less annoyed about these rules.

I am VERY annoyed by people who think they are very clever and they come to the US in a non-working status and then they are paid from abroad and say, "I can be here on B-2 or H-4 and work because I am paid from abroad."

Yeah, and I can claim Texas residence and live in California and avoid California taxes.  NO!

But that's a different story.

Post Date: Some immigration cases sound scary...

üò®Diversity visa lottery won, but USCIS didn't approve it in time. 
üò®Tried to fight it, but ended up in immigration court. 
üò®Deported. 
üò®Reentered the US before the 10yr bar.

BUT...

Don't be scared.  

Just see what else can happen in a "scary" case...

üéâEmployment-based I-140 approved
üéâWaiver approved
üéâGreen card approved
üéâ 20+ year complex US immigration history resolved

The outcome is anything but scary.

I love celebrating these outcomes with my clients, like the one who received his green card this weekend!
