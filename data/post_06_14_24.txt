Hey - if you are attending the big immigration law conference in Chicago this week, please say “hi” to my colleagues!

They are supposedly learning tons of good stuff. 

•••

Tomorrow they say they are going to an exclusive session off-site. I couldn’t find it on the program but I guess it starts after lunch at 1060 W. Addison. 

They claim the line-up is a for sure home run.

The July 2024 Visa Bulletin has been issued. 

There was unexpected forward movement for EB-1 India and also for EB-2 RoW. 

In a surprising move, the US Department of State did not issue a cut-off date for EB-3 RoW. It is just a poop emoji. 

Very childish, if you ask me.

Below are the RoW (Rest of World) dates for EB-1 and EB-2 and EB-3. 

EB-3 RoW went backwards by over a year!

The forever battle with USCIS is that it is not a fair fight. 

The adjudicators will ignore evidence or misstate information or take obviously warped and unreasonable views of information provided. 

It is therefore tempting to respond in-kind. 

And some people do. 

There are things that are rationalized based on the lack of good faith by the officers. 

But that is the wrong way forward (especially for licensed attorneys who have a certain standard for ethics). 

The lack of good faith by the officers combined with the miserable system that causes people to not be eligible for things or to only be eligible for things that will take forever. And therefore there are rationalizations for overstating things or taking absurd positions “because the government does it all the time.”

But don’t do it!

— Hold the line and maintain standards. 

— Push back on clients who have a “say anything” approach. 

— Be better than them (your clients and the government).

You may be stuck driving a Toyota but at the end of your career YOU will have fought the good fight. 

Fairly.

In the July 2024 Visa Bulletin, the India EB-1 cut-off date moved significantly. 

— In June 2024, the cut-off date was March 1, 2021. 

— For July 2024, the cut-off date has moved up to Feb 1, 2022. 

Excerpts are below. 

•••

This means a lot more Indian EB1 individuals will get green cards in July (yay!), but there will not necessarily be a lot more EB I-485 filings for EB-1 Indians because the new cut-off date does NOT create a new “high water mark.”

You see, EB-1 India was current through 12/31/2022 meaning that people with Dec 2022 EB-1 priority dates have already for the most part filed I-485 applications. 

Then the Jan 2023 Visa Bulletin introduced a cut-off date for EB-1 India of … wait for it … Feb 1, 2022. 

So basically there were so many people who filed EB-1 India based I-485s through 12/31/22 that the US government had to throttle back (retrogress) to Feb 2022 and throttle back further in 2023 and now by summer 2024 the cut-off date has been moved up to Feb 1, 2022 again. 

July each year is the first month of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and based on some technical rules it is traditional for DOS to make adjustments to cut-off dates to ensure use of all EB green cards available through the end of the fiscal year - Sept 30. 

These technical rules explain the notorious July 2007 Visa Bulletin, also released the week of the AILA conference like this year. 

•••

The July 2024 Visa Bulletin provides no further guidance on whether EB-1 India cut-off dates will  continue to move forward.

Since it seems like DOS is just making it up as they go along, that makes sense. I mean, back in April they said dates would not be moving forward at all “for several months.”

They don’t even bother to explain this change. 

It is good to see the cut-off dates moving forward but the US government continues to embarrass itself with the lack of visibility on the process. 

It would be like the Fed cutting rates 50 basis points this week. Maybe a good thing but completely abrupt and disruptive. 

But DOS and USCIS don’t care. 

They have contempt for us all and don’t even try to make the system sensible.

European E-2 dependent:  Approved for EB-2 NIW.

Today (June 7, 2024), we got an approval for a premium process EB-2 NIW I-140.  In this case, the wife is the "principal" E-2 for a small business and the husband was able to use his E-2S open-market work authorization to get a job as a technology and supply chain professional and then he self-petitioned for EB-2 NIW based on his profile.

The family will immigrant visa process and the wife will continue to run the small business in the meantime.

Many people rightfully lament that there is not necessarily a route to a green card for E-2 small business owners.  

Many people just try to plow ahead and file EB-2 NIW through the principal but not all small business owners on E-2s are well-suited for EB-2 NIW.

Less commonly considered is structuring the E-2 situation so that the 'better suited' spouse should be the dependent.

###

Not all nationalities are eligible for E-2s but for those nationalities who are eligible, "using" the dependent spouse as a means to getting a green card is often underutilized/underappreciated.

"EB-2 NIW" is a way for skilled professionals to self-petition for a green card without an employer.

To qualify for EB-2 NIW, an individual must have either -

-- (i) a Master's degree (US or foreign), or 

-- (ii) a Bachelor's degree (US or foreign) plus 5 years of documented post-Bachelor's work experience, or 

-- (iii) "exceptional ability" as documented by specific regulatory criteria.

###

If an individual meets the threshold education requirements above, then the individual must satisfy the 3-prong test laid out in Matter of Dhanasar, an administrative law case published in December 2016 (at the end of the Obama Administration).

To bolster Matter of Dhanasar, the Biden Administration has issued policy guidance (what I call the Dhanasar Force Multipliers).  The Dhanasar Force Multipliers policy guidance help articulate what qualifies as an endeavor of national importance, which is one of the key parts of analyzing Dhanasar.

The Force Multiplier memos in essence make it easier to get approved for EB-2 NIW.

###

With the above in mind, it is noteworthy at the Biden Administration's Department of Energy has just released $6 billion in funding to support industrial projects to reduce carbon missions.  These projects seek to reduce carbon emissions in wide swaths of the economy including the manufacturing of construction materials.  

The funding supports decarbonization efforts in the following industries:

- Iron
- Steel
- Cement & concrete
- Aluminum
- Chemicals
- Food & Beverage
- Pulp & Paper

Apparently 80% of the projects funded are in disadvantaged communities that have experience years of disinvestment.  (Something useful in documenting Dhanasar eligibility).

Further information about the huge federal financial support of these projects can be found in items linked in the comments below.

###

If you are a foreign national in the US in F-1 visa status or H-1B visa status or another temporary visa status, or frankly if you are a foreign national ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD with skills and experience relevant to the above, you might have a viable EB-2 NIW case.

Certainly engineers and other skilled professionals working at the specific companies funded by the DOE have potentially strong arguments that their work is of national importance.

###

EB-2 NIW remains an attractive option even for those who have an approved PERM-based I-140 as EB-2 NIW immigrant visa petitions (I-140s) can be filed as self-petitions versus PERM-based I-140s which are tied to (i) employer, and (ii) position, and (iii) location.  

Also, EB-2 NIW I-140s are eligible for premium processing for faster decision-making versus the very slow PERM labor certification process.  

Individuals with existing priority dates should be able to RETAIN those priority dates if they pursue EB-2 NIW.

In recent weeks I have been contacted by several people who live and work outside the United States and are interested in EB-2 NIW.

These are professionals who have never been to the United States.

While traditionally not common, it is possible to petition for a green card from abroad using EB-2 NIW.  It is not particularly fast and not everyone is eligible, but it might be the best option for someone who thinks their career will benefit from being able to live and work in the United States.

I will say that one other category that is coming up a lot recently are people who are in the US now but anticipate going abroad (because their temporary visa status runs out or because of personal/family/professional reasons) but want to return in a couple years.  EB-2 NIW could work well for those people.

###

With these people in mind, I have written an updated primer on EB-2 NIW for people who are trying to understand it, at a "101" level - although it dawns on me now that using Dwight from the Office in a meme might not be the right theme for a global audience.

Then again, President Biden has brought Scranton to the world!

EB-2 NIW I-140 petitions can be filed with USCIS via regular processing or premium processing.  

USCIS is raising the filing fee of premium processing for these kinds of cases from $2,500.00 to $2,805.00.

Are you getting something better or new and improved for the higher price?  No, of course not.

Pending I-140s can be 'converted' from regular to premium processing and USCIS has 45 calendar days to review the filing after the conversion request, although if the conversion is filed after April 1, 2024, then it is a gray area how things will be handled as April 1 is the date when USCIS goes from "calendar days" to "business days" in calculating things for premium processing.

Raising prices for slower processing.  Joy!

###

It is important to know that a premium process I-140 will not necessarily get you a green card faster so in many instances regular processing is just fine.  There are some instances where a premium process I-140 is important like (i) becoming eligible for an H-1B extension beyond 6 years or (ii) creating eligibility for an H-4 spouse to get an EAD.

You will want to analyze the pros and cons of premium processing case-by-case.  

Regular processing EB-2 NIW I-140 processing is slow.  Many cases are now pending 6 months or longer.  This is the way things work at USCIS.  They seem to neglect certain categories of cases and rationalize it by thinking, 'well, if you wanted it fast, you could pay for premium processing.'

Sometimes there will be an initiative to go faster.  That is not likely to occur with USCIS on this case type.  There is probably further rationalization within USCIS that because Visa Bulletin cut-off dates are backed up, there is no rush to process EB2 I-140s.  This is pretty much what they do for I-130s for family members.  

So, between the availability of premium processing and the rationalization of Visa Bulletin backlogs, I suspect USCIS will continue to rationalize slow and slower processing times.  Dumb & dumber.  Slow & slower.

###

Paying for premium processing is useful for peace of mind, knowing your case is approved.  

It is unfortunate that 'peace' is so expensive.  

But hey, everything is expensive these days.

Webber Law Firm 2.0 started two years ago as a solo practice - focused on employment-based immigration, with the occasional family-based matter and naturalization case in there. 

By the end of this month we will be a team of 20.  (Yeah, I am counting interns and law clerks). 

•••

Last year, to celebrate the firm’s first anniversary, we went to the Chaska Curling Center to test our skills on ice.

Since that time I have managed to bother you all on this platform over 17 million times!

Next week we have our second anniversary lunch outing with a bit of a surprise (although the only ice will be in our drinks).

•••

Thanks to our families, colleagues, clients for a busy past 24 months. 

Looking forward to what is in store in the months and years ahead!
